Title: A Bray Wyatt face turn could be the change in direction that his character needs

Body: In my opinion the Bray character has become pretty dull and oddly predictable and I think there's a decent amount of people on the sub with a similar opinion.

I think a face turn could actually be a great change of pace for his character and give him a chance to explore different ideas and interact with the fans in news ways.

When he teamed with Roman on Raw last year(?) we got a small glimpse of what it could be like, and I remember that match being pretty awesome.

I know there will be some people that disagree, so would be interested in hearing your opinions on the matter.

Q: What do you think?
A: How do you think they should do it?
