Title: So ummm... Where is Brodus Clay?

Body: I gotta ask, this has been bothering me for weeks. They hype him up like four weeks in a row and then he just drops from the earth... it's been like 6 weeks since his first mention...but we haven't heard about him in 2 weeks or so... driving me crazy...

Q: What do you think?
A: Probably at a McDonalds or Burger King wishing he didn't say what he did on Twitter.
