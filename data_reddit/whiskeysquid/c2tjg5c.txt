Title: My tattoo is not healing great..suggestions?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: I have a serious issue when using A&D it pulls color really bad. I started using aquaphor for the first day or 2 and then switch to a plain white lotion, i prefer cetaphil.

A: I do aquaphor for the first 3 days and then nothing after, I've not found a lotion that does not make me itch like crazy.

A: Plain ol' cocoa/shea butter once or twice a day when it's looking extra dry works wonders for me. Aquaphor for 3 days is really dynamite, though. I'm kinda pissed I didn't know about that for my older ones.

A: I've been using some kind of vasoline for men lotion my brother uses for his dry skin, and I can see some of the rash calming down and the tattoo feeling smoother so I guess alot of the scabbing is going away. It's just loosing alot of color but at this point I don't care what it looks like as long as it's healed.
