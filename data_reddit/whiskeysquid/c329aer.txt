Title: IAmA Nickelodeon Storyboard Artist. AMA and I'll draw it.

Body: AMA and I'll draw it.

Edit: Wow! Lots of responses- thanks everyone! I'll do my best to keep up! ;)

Edit: Front page! Not sure what to think since "Catdog pooping" is the highest voted drawing...

Edit: What a blast! I've been a reader of Reddit for only a few months. Today I signed up for an account to give this a try- I thought it'd make for a nice warm-up session before I did my day's work. Well, I should've known better. I drew for about 5 hours and got tons of requests. I wish I could've drawn everyone's but hey, maybe I'll just have to do this again sometime. I just finished drawing a request for a little girl's birthday this weekend and I think that's a good note to go out on. Thanks Reddit- you guys rock.

Q: What do you think?
A: Can you draw Xmens Wolverine walking into Paddy's Pub from It's always sunny in philadelphia with an eyebrow raised at the sight of Frank (danny devito) on the ground on his back like a turtle while Charlie and Fat Mac stand on top of the bar throwing peanuts at him.
