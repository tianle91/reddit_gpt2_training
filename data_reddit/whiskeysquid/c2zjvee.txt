Title: What is a movie that you will not watch again, because it was too rough to sit through?

Body: I was pondering this question after sitting in my film class, and we watched the one movie I told myself I would never watch again "Requiem for a Dream", and sure enough for aspects of film editing what do we watch "Requiem for a Dream".

My reason as to why I will not watch this Aronofsky masterpiece is the last act in that movie, but more specifically what happens to Marion. The degradation of character to perform the acts she does, just to get her fix is something that will be burned in my mind forever. This does not exclude what happens to Tyrone, Harry, and Sara. But that last act is why I won't watch this movie again, seeing it for a grade yes, but just out of free time, no.

Q: What do you think?
A: I know I'm probably the only one, But when I was a little kid maybe 11 or 12 my mom died and I seen this movie a little after. Rugrats in Paris..this song killed me. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1_tFlRko6o
