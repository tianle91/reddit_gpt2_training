Title: Stuck in a bit of a life rut, any suggestions on what to do?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: Begin living in the "now." Right at this moment do what you know is right and needs doing. Whatever that may be, do it with your entire attention. If you are washing your hands, wash them the absolute best you can, paying attention to the feel of the water, the color of the soap, the sound of the water, and the color of the towel you use to dry. Stop running scenarios about the future in your mind. Stop examining the past. Live for what is happening right now. Take care of what needs doing right now the best you are able, and the future will sort itself out in fine order. This is spelled out in a great book: "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle if you're interested.

A: Sounds good, but isn't everything we do ultimately altering our future? It sounds easy to not think about it but its always going to play a big part in how I determine on what I will do in the present.
