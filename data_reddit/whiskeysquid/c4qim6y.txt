Title: What music do you listen to when you work out Reddit?

Body: Well I've just finished my exams and now have just over four months before I start university (hopefully). I've planned out my exercise schedule already, now all that's missing is the music. So, what music do you like to listen to when you work out?

Edit: links appreciated :)

Q: What do you think?
A: DMX takes up alot of my playlist. Blink 182, Michael Buble, Green Day and other random bands I wouldn't normally listen to outside the gym but for some reason it comforts me while there.
