Title: [Callout] I don't know who you are, or what you want, but I need to fight you... /u/whiskeysquid.

Body: The arena: cyberpunk nightclub.  The climate: high of 68 degrees (Fahrenheit), with possible thunderstorms later this afternoon.  The mood: frisky.  Let's do this.

Q: What do you think?
A: (First timer here going on a whim) [[/u/whiskeysquid] taking the last shot of his night he pounds the glass onto the bartop and raises off the stool. The green polo complimented the colors of the large squid tattoo on his left arm.] [[/u/whiskeysquid]] notices another being connecting eyes. The blaring music from the dj filled the nightclub the beautifuly but alas he had to leave, exiting the club. Standing beside others outside the entrance he begins to light a cigarette]]

A: A hand reaches out of the darkness to light [/u/whiskeysquid]'s cigarette for him. The lighter in the gloved palm is old and rusted, and [/u/whiskeysquid] sees the date *1859* engraved on it. [/u/FullmetalCowboy] brings the lighter back to his own cigarette, and blows a long stream of smoke. The two stand like that for a while, watching the neon lights of 2045 Tokyo and feeling the pounding beat of the club music behind them. "Lots of rookies around these parts," says [/u/FullmetalCowboy] turning towards his adversary. "Street punks, martial artists. Sometimes you get to fight the Yakuza." He takes his cigarette and extinguishes it on the graffiti-covered wall. "But you've got to scout for talent everywhere these days. Every timeline, every place. Team Gunslinger's a little short on good fighters these days. But enough talk." [/u/FullmetalCowboy] gestures towards a deserted alleyway. "Shall we?"

A: "Im not sure what the hell team gunslinger is but...." [/u/whiskeysquid] flings his cigarette to the side. Noticing the woman at the door he approaches her as if he were to strike up conversation but instead, quickly grabs the martini glass from her grip, tossing it at [/u/fullmetalcowboy] with a quick 360 turn. Assuming [/u/fullmetalcowboy] would be distracted by the oncoming glass, [/u/whiskeysquid] dashes towards the opposing fighter at an abnormal speed making an attemp to hurl his fist upward aiming for the bottom of his jaw.
