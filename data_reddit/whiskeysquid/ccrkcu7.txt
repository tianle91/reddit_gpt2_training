Q: It was all just a life insurance scam.
A: Or a perfect storyline setup by Vince. At Hell in a Cell Alberto Del Rio will be standing in the ring waiting for John Cenas music to start playing when Vickies music plays instead. She stands at the top of the ramp and goes on to tell Del Rio that she was tricking him into thinking Cena would be his opponent so he'd be completely thrown off guard when she announces his new opponent. "You think I'm going to make you the face of the wwe just because you sweet talk me a little? Well I got news for you Del Rio, I'm taken..BY THIS MAN" Then you hear it.. "VIVA LA RASAAA" And the return is complete and Vince is a genius.
