Title: What are some bands you dismissed, or simply did not like at first... but later won you over?

Body: Came to think of this recently because I have been digging into Muse, I never liked what I heard on the radio, but as I dig deeper... HOLY SHIT!

Other bands for me were Jane's Addiction, Kyuss, STP (still dont like the very early stuff).

You?

Q: What do you think?
A: Coheed and cambria
