Title: Married man goes too far with a stripper

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I know a dude who ended up with the clap in his mouth from doing this. He ended up having to tell his wife when he wouldn’t kiss her and she wanted to know why. I don’t know what kind of symptoms he had but it was enough to go to the doctor. Takes a special kind of drunk to eat out a stripper.
