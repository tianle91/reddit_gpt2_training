Title: Which wrestler(s) do you currently have "go home" heat for?

Body: Besides Cena of course. That's the obvious choice for some.

I would say Jack Swagger. I could go without seeing him in the ring again.

I can't take him seriously at all, especially considering Ziggler is so much better.

Q: What do you think?
A: All the former Nexus guys with the exception of Wade Barrett.

A: And Daniel Bryan!

Q: And Daniel Bryan!
A: Daniel Bryan is okay in my book. Personally, and I know I'll get heat from this, but Zack Ryder. I don't get whats so special about him..Yeah his youtube thing is amusing but I don't see any outstanding talent in the ring.
