Q: Anybody else watch this on Albino Black Sheep when they were 8, too?
A: I was closer to fifteen, I think, but yeah. Also, when I was a junior and senior, I went to a high school where everything was done on computers. It was actually a great educational environment... but of course, my friends and I would all spend quite a bit of time browsing the Internet. Our favorite sites were: 1. AlbinoBlackSheep 2. The Best Page in the Universe 3. Newgrounds 4. Homestar Runner 5. Fark 6. A bunch of webcomics. Needless to say, I learned a lot in school.
