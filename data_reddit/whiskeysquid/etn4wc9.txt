A: Anyone on ps4 mess with the field view? I've been reading it could help gameplay if you raise it but i also read it makes aiming worse. Any opinions?

A: Hmm good question since I changed it a few months ago it’s hard to say but off the top of my head I’d say the biggest advantage is being able to see more in your periphery. Big advantage being able to see more on the sides without having to turn. Disadvantages would be initially there’s kind of a fish bowl effect and you feel like you’re moving faster (even though of course you’re not). It can also lower performance but I’ve never noticed any drops on a PS4 Pro. I recommend giving it a try since usually more information usually equals better especially in first person shooters.
