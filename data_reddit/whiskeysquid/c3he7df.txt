A: Yea, i'm trying to figure out if that's what the artist was going for, or if he just fails at shading. Also, Batman's arm is way off, unless it's just the angle of the picture.

A: I'm getting it finished up next week and I'll post the end results, the picture the artist took was way better than what my phone can take lol. I had to stop there because I literally had like a half hour before I had to go to work. He's going to color it in and touch up the shading he said.
