Title: [US] These Final Hours(2014): Counting down the hours before a meteor strike destroys the planet, a man fleeing from his worries on his way to a party saves a little girl and helps her get to her dad. Great movie with lots of emotion and makes you think "what if?".

Q: What do you think?
A: Seeking a friend for the end of the world is also a great movie with the same subject. Also it's pretty funny at times. But also very very sad towards the end.
