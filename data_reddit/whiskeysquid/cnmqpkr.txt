Title: [DC TV-verse] Why there is no Batman or Superman

Body:   What if the Oliver queen is the batman of the tv-verse and flash is the superman of the same universe, it would explain why supes and bats are never mentioned.
Oliver has Diggle instead of Alfred
Felicity instead of oracle,
New black canary instead of bat girl and
arsenal instead of robin

What if the justice league movies are split into two part because there will be a crises on the infinite earths, arrow vs batman, flash vs superman, ATOM vs cyborg.

Thoughts?

Q: What do you think?
A: In one of the scenes where they show the future newspaper, there is an article on the bottom left that mentions Wayne corp.. Doesn't mean batman exactly but the Wayne's are defiantly there somewhere
