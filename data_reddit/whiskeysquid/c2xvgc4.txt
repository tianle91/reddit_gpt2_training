Title: What is the most memorable match you remember seeing as a child?

Body: The match between Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VI sticks out to me.  From the opening moments where they are just standing face to face exchanging pushes to the finishing body splash to win the WWF Championship.  

Q: What do you think?
A: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcXT4SPekpI The first match I really remember ever having a jaw dropping moment.. going into school the next day and have all my buddies talk about how they can't believe that happened.
