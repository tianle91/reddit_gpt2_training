Q: What do you think?
A: I don't know what fire means in this context. But I'm awake and listening. Tell us about what's happening and just turn the water on when you poop yo.

A: I passed out pretty quick lol. It wasn't as weird as I was expecting. I thought everyone figured out I was high so I snuck off and passed out in the neighbors house. Neighbors were good friends
