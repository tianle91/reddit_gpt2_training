Title: If these wrestlers hadn't passed away, do you think that they would've stuck around with WWE or would they have eventually left?

Body: - Owen Hart
- Chris Benoit
- Eddie Guerrero 

Q: What do you think?
A: I think Owen Hart would have been long gone by now. I could see Guerrero sticking around as a decent heel and maybe even face turning to feud with Del Rio. And I never heard of the other guy, got it?
