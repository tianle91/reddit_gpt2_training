Title: My tattoo is not healing great..suggestions?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: while getting my last tattoo I asked the artist if he has ever had someone get an allergic reaction from getting one and he said a lot of people get a reaction from the ink color red. Not sure if he used any in yours or not though.
