Edit: The episode is actually "To Be, Act 1," not "To Be (Pt. 1)."  Turns out not everything on Wikipedia is true.  Who knew?

Q: What do you think?
A: I watched this episode the night after it aired on TV and my dad played a little prank on me saying Gemma discovered that Potter was actually JT trying to destroy what Clay stole from him. After watching Obviously it wasn't true but then I began to think to myself what if it really is true? The picture of JT did kind of look like Potter.
