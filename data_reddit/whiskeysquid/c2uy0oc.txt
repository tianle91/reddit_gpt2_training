Title: Did anyone else get a Cowboy Bebop vibe watching the movie Drive?

Body: I don't know if it's just me but between the soundtrack and the awkward "love" story between the two it just reminded me alot of Cowboy Bebop lol 

Q: What do you think?
A: I think the way the songs they'd play with the female singer going along with the slow pace montage sort of scenes stood out most when comparing to to Bebop.
