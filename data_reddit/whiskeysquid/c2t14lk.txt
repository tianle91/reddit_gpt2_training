Q: What do you think?
A: You'll do ridiculous things to make people laugh..but you keep the ridiculousness to a limit. You play an instrument and if not you'd like to but just don't have the time or patience to learn. You're single but have no problems meeting women who fill that gap in your life with meaningless sex. I would have a beer with you because you also seem like the guy who at a bar, would get your friends laid before you see to yourself.
