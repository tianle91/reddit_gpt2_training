Title: [TOMT][Song] Rock Song that sounds like its from a western.

Body: I think the band was from Japan, but it wasn't really J rock. Only this song sounded like this, the rest sounded like typical rock and roll. I think the band had x or & in the name. 

Q: What do you think?
A: https://youtu.be/Q3Yc3HhSl1Q That's kind of westerny, no?
