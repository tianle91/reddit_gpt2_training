Title: What do redditors do to pass the time during long minimum-wage shifts???

Body: Just started working in a kiosk in the middle of a busy shopping center, however there isn't a large amount of people I need to serve and almost no cleaning so I need some suggestions on how to kill time. Anything???

Q: What do you think?
A: Since you're in the middle of a busy mall, act like one of those insult clowns you have to dunk in the pool. Just start yelling insults at people passing by.
