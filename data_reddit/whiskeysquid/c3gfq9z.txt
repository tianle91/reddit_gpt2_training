Title: Reddit, What is the stupidest thing you've said to your crush?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: One time I took this girl I liked out to eat at this Chinese restaurant and I think I had some bad sushi or something. Anyway we get back to my car and i start coughing and out of no where all the food I ate comes rushing out of my mouth all over my dash board and all I could do is pinpoint a peice of broccoli on her leg and I knew she was looking at it too. I said "i dont remember eating broccoli"...It was awkward to say the least. Her and I have been dating for 2 and a half years now.
