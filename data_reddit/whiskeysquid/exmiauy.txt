Title: Petition to make RPAN a permanent thing

Body: Twitch might do the same thing with IRL streams, but the magic is with RPAN that you don't have to be a famous streamer with an established personality for people to actually watch you. RPAN is raw humanity - the good, the bad, and the weird - put on display for everyone to see, and that's what makes it so unique and refreshing. I would love to see this expanded with things like subreddit specific streams and more available slots in the future.

Q: What do you think?
A: Is it accessible on baconreader?
