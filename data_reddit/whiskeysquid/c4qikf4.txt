Title: What was your wake up call in life?

Body: I am unable to sleep, why not continue posting random thoughts. 

To this point in life, my biggest wake up was when my brother was kicking me off his couch after a whole year with him with much to remember but nothing to show.  It was sad to feel like you let your family down.  I decided to gain purpose and wake up every morning loving life instead of being pessimistic and continuing my slight sociopathic ways.  

what is yours?

Q: What do you think?
A: Opening up my first student loan bill.
