Title: I've been working at a well known Gas Station in Pennsylvania for 21 months AMA

Body: I'm 22. Took a year off of college recently and bored this morning. I've been working at this place for 21 months on 3rd shift. We even have our own little made to order stand where you can order hot/cold food well..made to order. AMA !

Q: What do you think?
A: Whats the longest time you've worked there straight (as in non-stop/not gone home)?

A: I usually go in 11pm-7am. If someone from first or second shift calls off they usually ask me or the other two 3rd shifters if we want to pick up an extra shift. Once I went in for second shift at 3pm and worked my usual 11-7. so 3pm-7am. Then had to go back at 11 next night.

A: Reminds me of a time I worked 24 straight hours between two jobs, one of which being at a gas station. That was a tired day. I had to cover for the nightshift 'cause no one else could.

A: Everyone hates night shifts at gas stations. The gas station of the same name literally right up the road gets robbed constantly but my store is more out in the open on the main road so no robberies so far.
