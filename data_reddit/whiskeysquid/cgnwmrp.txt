Q: What do you think?
A: I'm surprisingly happy for not only him but for his family that they were able to make peace with the company at the right time. I say surprisingly only because I'm not usually this upset when a wrestler passes. Warrior is the reason I started watching wrestling when I was a kid ever since my dad introduced me to it. I used to have this huge cloth poster type thing which was all black and white and had the warrior in the middle with so many cool graphics around it, it was even signed and im shamed to say it got ruined in a flood years ago. Heres to the matches warrior and savage are putting on in a better place. Shit
