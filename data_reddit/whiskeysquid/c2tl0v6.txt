A: It used to be unhealthy the amount of metal I used to listen to. I still listen to some, but around senior year of high school I opened up to a lot of new generes and now I listen to pretty much everything.

A: i thought so :) you just reminded me of my boyfriend. he's the same way. like he listened to stuff like three inches of blood (i think?) but now he pretty much just listens to mastodon. he's also expanded to other genres like country, which is on the total other end of the spectrum haha.

A: Nice lol, I don't really listen to country. I started to like dubstep and slower more indie acoustic stuff lol. Your boyfriend sounds like a good man lol.

A: I like City and Colour. I'm still kind of new to the genre so I'm not exactly sure you'd classify some of it as indie lol.
