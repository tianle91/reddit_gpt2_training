Title: Anyone else getting increased connection to server errors???

Body: As the title states. Anyone else getting increased connection to server errors???

Q: What do you think?
A: Constantly. It sucks when you're with a party and you're the only one who gets knocked off the server then you have to wait for them to finish.
