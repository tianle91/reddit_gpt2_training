Title: 1/2/2012 Promo Discussion Thread

Body: Today on Wikipedia, it said that the 1/2/12 promo was for Skip Sheffield returning in a "Terminator" gimmick. About 8 hours later, I checked back and the information was removed. This could mean that it was asked to be removed or it was false information. It's pretty weird. Now I' having doubts about Jericho's return.


What are your thoughts?

Q: What do you think?
A: Couldn't anyone go on there and say it was anyone? The scribbled out Chris on the notebook in the latest video was a clue I'm guessing. I'd like it to be Jericho and WWE seems to be doing pretty well with pleasing the fans as of late. The start of 2012 with the return of Jericho would be awesome.
