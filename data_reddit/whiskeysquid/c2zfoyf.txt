Title: r/SquaredCircle, What's the worst possible match you can think of?

Body: I pose a challenge: Come up with the worst wrestling match that could ever possibly take place.  Just so we don't get too crazy, here are the ground rules:

**1. It can include any wrestlers, living or dead**

**2. It must obey the laws of physics and human conditioning (no 14 week iron man matches, John Cena clones, or fights on Mars)**

So, let's see who can channel the creative powers of Vince Russo and come up with the most horrid matchup.

Q: What do you think?
A: Scott Steiner vs Mason Ryan in a 2 out of 3 falls match. First will be a debating match where the 2 have 10 minutes each to argue why they're so genetically dominant. 2nd match, bra and panties.. If there is a 3rd it will be an all out, no holds barred one hand ties behind there backs bull rope match. Winner gets Natalyas hand in marriage.
