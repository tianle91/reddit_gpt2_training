Title: [Callout] I don't know who you are, or what you want, but I need to fight you... /u/whiskeysquid.

Body: The arena: cyberpunk nightclub.  The climate: high of 68 degrees (Fahrenheit), with possible thunderstorms later this afternoon.  The mood: frisky.  Let's do this.

Q: What do you think?
A: (First timer here going on a whim) [[/u/whiskeysquid] taking the last shot of his night he pounds the glass onto the bartop and raises off the stool. The green polo complimented the colors of the large squid tattoo on his left arm.] [[/u/whiskeysquid]] notices another being connecting eyes. The blaring music from the dj filled the nightclub the beautifuly but alas he had to leave, exiting the club. Standing beside others outside the entrance he begins to light a cigarette]]
