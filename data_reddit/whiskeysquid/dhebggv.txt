Title: Last night was Patty Mills' first 40+ minute game in the NBA. It was James Harden's 170th.

Body: I was just fiddling around with some stats. 8 of those were for OKC. I think you can see the McHale/D'Antoni effect when you look at the season by season numbers:

12/13: 40

13/14: 41

14/15: 25

15/16: 39

16/17: 17

Q: What do you think?
A: With his performance I'm hoping he has a lot more in the future
