Q: What do you think?
A: What makes it popular and what’s the worst customer you’ve ever had? Along those lines, what’s the weirdest request a customer has asked for/about?

A: Popular in the sense that it is a well known chain. A funny request once was a guest had wanted a framed picture of Steve Irwin hugging an alligator on each bed. As for the worst customer experience, there has been so many bad ones it's hard to choose. We get a lot of snobby guests who expect the most luxurious of stays from an economy brand. They are the ones who come in with coupons for a 50 dollar room and will always make a big scene so other guests can hear them.
