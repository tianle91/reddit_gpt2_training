Title: What non mainstream match would you recommend to others, and vice-versa?

Body: I'd love to see the opinions of people here as to what non mainstream match, or show, you'd recommend to existing wrestling fans and why. They can already be puro, lucha, or indy fans, so the concern isn't as much a match to keep them watching or ditch the mainstream.

And just for fun let's also include mainstream matches you'd use to convince mainstream haters that WWE/TNA isn't all that bad.

For me it would have to be the Up in Smoke to FIST for the CDP in CHIKARA. Sure Cloudy vomits, but UIS make great underdogs and I think the match does the 2/3 falls stipulation really well. My other pick would have to be Drew Mcintyre vs Chris Masters from Superstars. Great back and forth match that told a story, made both men look good, and given just enough time. Great example of what CM Punk meant about Masters' release. 

Q: What do you think?
A: I enjoyed the CM Punk vs Bryan Danielson match. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR-ItPo1zPo
