Q: What do you think?
A: I've heard of WAY too many people who go out of their way to tour my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania because it's the setting for "The Office" sitcom. Only problem is, Scranton is known for three things: political corruption, crippling debt, and "The Office." They didn't even *film* the show here, just the establishing shots for the intro. Needless to say, they all wasted their time (and mine by tying up traffic).

A: My favorite part about Hazleton was the HUGE campaign to fight off the illegal immigrants (made the news here in Pittsburgh as well as national)...
