Title: I work at a popular hotel. AMA

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I know you may not want to name the chain, but can you describe what *type* of hotel this is? Business hotel? Destination resort? Roadside budget hotel? Airport, urban, or rural setting? What exactly is your job at the hotel? Any "secrets" for getting a better rate? Do you have any discretion to set rates if a customer just walks in?

A: It's an economy brand which is pretty much between a local one night stand motel and a five star hotel. It's in a city surrounded by tourist cities but not a tourist spot itself. I check people in/out and help guest however I can. Most of the time if you say you have AAA they'll give you a discount anywhere without even verifying if you do. I'm told to try to read guests when they walk through the door and if I have a feeling they are local I should always up the price. I'm 100% in control of what price you get as long as it's higher than the best available rate. Sometimes I can go lower under special circumstances like if it's really late in the night or they want to stay for a week or so.
