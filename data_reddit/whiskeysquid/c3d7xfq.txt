Title: Question regarding WWE12

Body: I didn't know where else to post this so I'm asking you Wreddit. Just wondering in WWE12 is there a way to switch titles to a different brand. I wanted to move the IC title to Raw and replace the US title with the European title. Didn't know if it was possible or not

Q: What do you think?
