Title: I just got Netflix. What movies/TV series should I watch?

Body: I don't gel much toward horror or action movies, but I do like some sci-fi stuff which can get gory on its own. I gravitate toward comedies and dramas. Foreign films are excellent too (I speak Spanish, so that throws me into the ring for Latin-American and Spanish productions w/o subs).

Hit me with your best shot!

EDIT: I'm grateful for all the suggestions already. But could you also add a reason behind what makes whatever film/show a good one, and whether or not your suggestion is a movie or series, please.

Q: What do you think?
A: Some good foreign ones are D13, The Host (A good japanese monster movie). Zero Day is deffinatly worth a watch.
