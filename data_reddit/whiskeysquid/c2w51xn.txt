Title: Going to Raw in a few weeks, sign suggestions?

Body: Going to the november 21st show of Raw and was thinking of blowing up an image of the disastrous The Rock yell from Cena with the spit but thought they might take it away lol. Was also going to make a /r/squaredcircle sign. Thoughts? 

Q: What do you think?
