Title: Whose Line Is It Wednesday. /r/SquaredCircle edition

Body: Concept is stolen from /r/hockey and /r/baseball.

The rules:

-Keep skits in the form of a statement, not a question.

-Any skits longer than two lines should be in quotations.

-If you add any additional commentary, put the skit in quotations.

If you don't understand the concept, a skit looks like this:

"Things you could measure Big Show's weight in rather than pounds."
