Title: I've been working at a well known Gas Station in Pennsylvania for 21 months AMA

Body: I'm 22. Took a year off of college recently and bored this morning. I've been working at this place for 21 months on 3rd shift. We even have our own little made to order stand where you can order hot/cold food well..made to order. AMA !
