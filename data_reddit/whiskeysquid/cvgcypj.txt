Title: I'm 19, incredibly lonely and depressed AMA.

Body: Like the title says, I'm 19 just started Uni, living on my own for the first time. I've been lonely and depressed for the last 2 years and it doesn't seem to be improving. Thought this AMA would be a good idea seeing as I have nothing else going on. 

Ask Me Anything (literally)

Q: What do you think?
A: What's making you depressed?
