Title: If Stone Cold returned today to the WWE, who would you most like to see receive a stunner?

Body: What?

Q: What do you think?
A: I could see the miz having him on his talk show. Miz comes down the ramp but no mizdow to be found. Glass shatters and out comes Damian Coldow in a bald cap and vest. He begins to do the four corner poses but miz cuts him off. Miz yells yada yada the real Austin comes out and cuts a little promo poking fun at Coldow every now and then. He gets beers thrown in the ring when Coldow catches one of the cans. Before he can open it miz slaps the can out if coldows hand and Coldow hits miz with a stunner. The crowd goes insane assuming their not in Memphis and right when Coldow turns around bam Austin hits him with a stunner.
