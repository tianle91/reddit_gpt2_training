Title: [Spoilers] My prediction for the end of season

Body: * Clay is dead or mortally wounded and in the hospital
* Bobby is in jail
* Op dies


With no one suitable left to run the club Jax can't leave and is forced to take over as interm president.   

What I don't know is how the following items will get tied into place:

* Cartel has to end this season
* Charming heights ties in somehow
* Creepy Fed needs to get what's coming to him (I think the sheriff is going to screw him somehow)



Q: What do you think?
A: just another brain fart - what if the cartel thinks it killed Tara but actually ended up killing Wendy...

A: In the trailer for this tuesdays upcoming episode it kind of does look like Wendy is being thrown into a window or something like that, but doesnt Romeo know what Tara looks like? Either way this season is too good.
