Title: What Are Some Good Jobs For People of Low IQ (~90)?

Body: My nephew was recently, after bouts of difficulty at school and a number of issues, taken to a psychologist. Among other things, the evaluations found a low IQ.

His parents are understandably terrified as to what the future holds for him. He's not rainman: there's no particular skill or talent in his repertoire that can be enhanced upon, at least that we've found so far. He has no manual/creative skills (he's been offered a number of activities, with one-on-one training, including music, the arts, various manual skills), and doesn't pick up new ones well. Sweet, wonderful, mostly kind, and not intelligent.

Reddit, give my family some hope. What are some reasonably well-paying and/or reasonably secure jobs for this kid?
