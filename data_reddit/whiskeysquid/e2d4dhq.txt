Title: I have conducted a scientific analysis of the WWE roster, and there's only one man who can defeat Brock Lesnar and rescue the Universal Title.

Body: Fact: Brock Lesnar is an impressive physical specimen who tends to brute force his way through opponents, particularly opponents of comparable size and physical strength (Big Show, Undertaker, Kane, Braun Strowman, etc.).

Fact: Brock Lesnar's offense consists primarily of German suplexes, the F-5, vertical suplexes, overhead belly-to-belly suplexes, and occasionally running at the opponent and throwing knees into their faces repeatedly. This accounts for roughly 95% of Brock Lesnar's offense in the last 6 years.

Fact: All attempts to defeat Brock Lesnar by simply overpowering him fail. His losses in the past 6 years have either come from massive damage to the head/back on steel stairs (Cena/HHH) or when someone else is pinned in a multiman match. The last time Brock Lesnar was pinned outside that situation was as a result of a good lucha thing by Eddie Guerrero (see exhibit 1). Edit - Brock beat Goldberg at Wrestlemania, and by the laws of wrestling's transitive property, Goldberg's wins against Brock are therefore nullified.

Exhibit 1: [a good lucha thing](https://youtu.be/dkx-p_JpYyk?t=332).

Conclusion: Brock Lesnar cannot be defeated under normal circumstances except by good lucha things.

Fact: There is one man in WWE who has the desire, the *ganas*, to make a good lucha thing, god damnit woo (see exhibit 2). He wants to shock the world, and nothing would shock the world more than defeating Brock Lesnar and winning the Universal Title

Exhibit 2: [las ganas de hacer una good lucha thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe6KX3pkA70). God damn it, woo.

Fact: Kalisto's finisher is perfectly tailored toward nullifying the bulk of Brock Lesnar's offense. The German suplex is a perfect setup for the Salida del Sol, and vertical suplexes can be turned into small packages (see Exhibits 3 and 4).

Exhibit 4: Kalisto knows what to do [against a vertical suplex](https://youtu.be/iIm2niVY8b4?t=43).

Fact: Kalisto is too short to be hit by Brock's flying knees. See exhibit 5.

Exhibit 5: Brock does his [flying knee to Braun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNzhYzCLzEE), catching Braun in the face/shoulders. Kalisto is half Braun's height. Brock would sail over his head.

Fact: Kalisto has already defeated Braun Strowman, showing he knows how to be nimble and defeat giants. See exhibit 6.

Exhibit 6: [Kalisto defeats Braun Strowman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zc8Isiqj8).

Conclusion: The only move in Brock Lensar's arsenal that might hurt Kalisto is the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, which is trivially countered into a neckbreaker by a master of lucha things. Kalisto has defeated giants and has demonstrated all the skills necessary to defeating Brock Lesnar.

He is our only hope. God damn it, woo.
