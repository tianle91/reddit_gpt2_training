Title: What does everyone think about this Prediction: Kane will win the royal rumble in spot number 40

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: It would be nice to see Kane finally win a Rumble but I just can't see it happening. I thought up something along the lines of Daniel Bryan cashing in his briefcase sometime before the rumble but loosing. Then have Bryan win the rumble and go on to Wrestlemania and win the title. A man could dream..
