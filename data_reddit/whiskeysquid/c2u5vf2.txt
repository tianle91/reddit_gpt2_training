Title: My tattoo is not healing great..suggestions?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: My friends dad told me to put peroxide on the tattoo to heal the scabbing faster. The scabbing has gone down alot than what it was without using the peroxide at all. Is peroxide a good method? I am skeptical of using it but if it heals faster I'll try it. At this point i dont even care how the tattoo looks afterwards I talked to a local artist with his own shop he said he can fix it once it heals.
