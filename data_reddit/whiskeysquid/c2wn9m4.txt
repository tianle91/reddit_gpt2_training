Title: What's YOUR theme song?

Body: The lights dim, a spotlight sets it focus on the stage, you begin your approach to the ring...what song rings out as your masculine figure bestows the arena with your awesome stage presence? 

Me: [Warriors of the World United - Manowar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhE9_y76hw)

Q: What do you think?
A: [Kevin Rudolf - Let It Rock ft. Lil Wayne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0n4eMGXAyk&ob=av3e) Before you judge, I'll tell you how to make this work: * The stage would be hollywood style searchlights, green and yellow ambience. * Lots and lots of fogs on my entranceway * Pyro in the middle of "Dir-ty" in the first line: I see your, dir-(pyro)-ty face, hide behind the..." * Another pyro section the way shawn michaels does in his ring, but along side the titantron. It will happen as I begin a gesture (jump up like I was jumproping, fistpumping with my finger to the sky) during "i maaaaaade myyyyyyyyy" and end it by pointing a sweeping motion [as soon as the chorus hits] * My gimmick is an easygoing party kid (hell i'd even job every weekn and wouldn't mind) with the highflying style of Evan Bourne and the cunning of Edge. With that gimmick, the most I could probably achieve is the US Title, in a wonderful crowd-popping underdog fluke program where everyone loves me but expects me to lose (you know, because I'm a jobber). And then I start running up and down the arena like a boy in a candy store and yell and high five the fans. the most i would hold that first reign would be 2 weeks tops, where i valiantly try to defeat the scripted winner, and end up on my knees, head low and feeling disappointed at myself after the match... and evolve my character a little bit to make myself more determined to win it back. *sigh*... a man can dream.
