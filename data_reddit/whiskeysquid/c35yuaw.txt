Title: Wreddit's Slammy Awards

Body: Before Monday's Slammy Awards, I'd love to hear Wreddit's thoughts on this past year!  Without getting too complex, I threw together some categories (but certainly are not limited to) that are up for discussion:

* Superstar of the Year

* Breakout Performer of the Year

* Heel of the Year

* Best Moment/Surprise/Pop of the Year

* Match of the Year

* Wredditor of the Year

This isn't necessarily a prediction thread for the results for Monday, more of our own discussion on who REALLY should win.

Q: What do you think?
A: * Superstar of the year : CM Punk * Breakout Performer of the Year : Cody Rhodes * Heel of the Year : Mark Henry, Mainly because he is really the only heel that acts like a genuine bad guy. * BEst Moment/Surprise/Pop of the Year : The Rock being announced as Wrestlemania Host I think got the biggest pop. * Match of the Year : CM Punk vs John Cena at MITB *Wredditor of the Year : MickFoley
