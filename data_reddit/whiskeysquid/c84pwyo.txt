* Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) will finally put their differences behind them, as they must defend their WWE Tag Team Championships against the coordinated Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow.) 

* In a rematch from a few weeks ago, the Mexican Aristocrat, Alberto Del Rio, must defend his newly-earned World Heavyweight Championship against the destructive monster, The Big Show, in a **Last Man Standing** match. 

* The Traditional Royal Rumble match will feature thirty superstars from the past, present, and future, all vying for an opportunity to challenge either the WWE Champion, or World Heavyweight Champion, at Wrestlemania XXIX. [Who win this year's Royal Rumble?](http://imgur.com/cNn1MnQ)

* **FINALLY!** The Rock... **has come back!** to the Royal Rumble! CM Punk, the longest reigning WWE Champion of the Modern Era, must defend we coveted WWE Championship against the People's Champion - the most electrifying man in Sports Entertainment - The Rock.
