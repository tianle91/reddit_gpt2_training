Title: With all the Shield on the same show, which one should turn heel (if any) ?

Body: Seems weird to have them all on the same show, all good guys.. I'm honestly thinking it may be Dean's time soon. But what does everyone else think? 

Roman as a heel kind of seems like a lost cause by this point. 

Q: What do you think?
A: I've been hoping for an Ambrose heel turn soon.
