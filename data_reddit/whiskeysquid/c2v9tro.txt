Title: WWE '12: Share your storylines

Body: With an impending WWE game over our heads, I can imagine some of you are already creating your own storylines/feuds to play. So, why not share it with your fellow wredittors? 

Who is gonna start as champions? Who they will defend their titles against? Which hall of famer will return to the regular roster? All of them? None of them? Is 'taker going to be 20-0 in your storyline? Or 19-1? Please do tell us all the details and we will se if you can be ~~better than Vince Russo~~ a good booker!

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm going to have Ziggler start off as IC champ on Raw. Ryder as US Champ on smackdown. Punk as WWE Champ on Raw and Cena World Champ on Smackdown. I want to do a sort of midcard rising thing where Ziggler claims to have the most prestigious championship in the business because Punk has killed the value of the wwe championship to start a Ziggler/Punk feud. Then have Cody Rhodes in a stable with Daniel Bryan, Christian and Wade Barret to uprise against Cena with Rhodes leading the pack and eventually taking the title from Cena. First Wrestlemania will see Ziggler vs Punk with both championships on the line. John Cena vs Cody Rhodes(royal rumble winner) for world championship. Ryder vs. D.Bryan for US title. Barret/christian vs. Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel for the tag belts. and Taker v. HHH keeping his streak. Just me though lol
