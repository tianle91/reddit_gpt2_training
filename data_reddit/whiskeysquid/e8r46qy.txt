A: I found a dude passed out outside one of our back doors one night doing third shift. Scared the hell outta me initially but was just a drunk who couldn't find his room after the wedding we were hosting. Didn't keep him, returned him to his room. Also found a pretty neat Game Of Thrones bookmark which I did keep.
