Title: What are your Wrestlemania 28 card predictions?

Body: Tickets are about to go on sale, so now is as good of a time as ever to predict what the card will look like.

I have to say this is really tough to pinpoint for me... Cena says his match with Rock will be for the WWE Championship.  Daniel Bryan says he's going to cash in his MiTB for a championship match at Wrestlemania.  The winner of the Royal Rumble gets a world title shot.  That's three title matches but only two titles.  Oh well, here goes.

- The Rock vs. John Cena
- Daniel Bryan vs. CM Punk (c) (WWE Championship) [I haven't decided which one of these guys would turn heel.]
- Randy Orton vs. Sheamus (c) (World Heavyweight Championship) [Orton would be a heel by now.]
- HHH vs. Undertaker
- Alberto del Rio vs. Big Show
- Cody Rhodes vs. Mason Ryan (Intercontinental vs. US Champion)
- The Miz, R-Truth, Christian, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger vs. Santino Marella, Zack Ryder, Alex Riley, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne (Elimination Tag... or some other kind of gimmick match.  I'd love to see MiTB back.)
- Rey Mysterio vs. Sin Cara [Face vs. face I guess.]
- Mark Henry vs. Kane
- An awful Diva's match -- Is Kharma supposed to be back yet?

That was harder than I thought -- A lack of MiTB means throwing all of the mid to uppermid carders into a random tag match.  Meh.

Q: What do you think?
A: Undertaker vs Wade Barrett--WWE Championship The Rock vs John Cena (Cena wins Chamber match causing punk to lose.Cena looses wm, becomes heel to feud with rock until mitb) -- IC title match- Cody Rhodes vs Randy Orton. (Orton winning, causing ic title to become more mainstream again) -- US Title - Ziggler vs Jack Swagger --Rey Mysterio vs Alberto Del Rio -- CM Punk vs Kevin Nash-- world championship Mark Henry vs Kane vs Daniel Bryan -- Zack Ryder, sin cara, air boom vs christian, miz, r truth, and hunico -- Just a thought lol, I think it would be cool. couldnt think of a random mid card throw in lol
