Title: What is the shittiest city you've visited only once and completely refuse to return?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I've heard of WAY too many people who go out of their way to tour my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania because it's the setting for "The Office" sitcom. Only problem is, Scranton is known for three things: political corruption, crippling debt, and "The Office." They didn't even *film* the show here, just the establishing shots for the intro. Needless to say, they all wasted their time (and mine by tying up traffic).
