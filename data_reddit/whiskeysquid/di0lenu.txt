Title: I've just binged the first 2 seasons on Netflix. Seriously, fuck Chuck

Body: Haven't seen anything of season 3 yet but already my conclusion is firmly set at this man being a horrible dick and he will never redeem himself and I hope Jimmy learns this soon and never forgives him.  Reminds me of Inspector Javert. Fuck this guy 

Q: What do you think?
A: Fuck Chuck? One of us. One of us.
