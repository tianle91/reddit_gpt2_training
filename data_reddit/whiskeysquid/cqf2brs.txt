Title: [WP] Over time you realize every time you go to a store the same shoppers and employees are there each and every time. You have never seen them anywhere else, and none of them seem to leave.

Q: What do you think?
A: "Hey, Carol." Ethan said as he entered the supermarket, greeting the employee who he'd see every visit. He wandered the aisles and filled a plastic hand cart with items from the shelves limited selection. "Mark, how's the wife?" Ethan chuckled as he greeted a fellow shopper turning into a different aisle. He hummed a light melody with a smile beaming from his face. "Anymore Frosted Flakes in the back, Lucy?!" Ethan shouted to the employee stocking shelves in the next aisle over. No response. After a while of browsing a near empty grocery store, Ethan stepped into the checkout line humming that same tune he had stuck in his head for weeks and bearing that same smile he so reluctantly wore. "Oh, thanks Bruce." Ethan said as he skipped ahead in line and pointed at Bruce's empty basket. "Guess you're not in a rush, huh?" He laughed and patted Bruce on the shoulder and sighed as a loud thump echoed through the store. He placed his groceries on the counter only to place them right back in after leaving a handful of change on the register. He stepped over Bruce's fallen arm and walked to the exit doors. "See you all next week!" Ethan yelled as he waved goodbye to the store full of dressed up manakins. He left the store and took in a deep breathe as he looked over at the fallen and decaying landscape mixed with rubble from demolished buildings and old cars tipped over and stripped for parts.
