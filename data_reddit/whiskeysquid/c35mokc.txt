Title: Curious what people think. :x

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: You're 23. You're favorite movie is Punch-Drunk Love. You spoil the hell out of your dog for a good reason, he/she has helped you through a hardship in your life, possibly a bad breakup or death of a close one. When you go out, you're friend (who is slightly more attractive, not saying you're ugly because you're not) gets hit on alot and makes you aggrivated but you don't care because you don't like that whole "hook-up" scene. What's up

A: 25, never seen that movie. My mom spoils the dog actually(it's hers), but we are close and pretty dead on with helping me through a hardship. Every time I see her she's very clingy to me :) When I do go out, which is rarely I usually am the quiet awkward one so yeah, the people I'm with get hit on and mingle more. But it doesn't' really bother me. I'm generally counting the minutes till I get to go home and play Assassin's Creed or something.
