Title: [spoiler] So out of all the Senseates this season, which was your favorite and why?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Wolfgang, he is an all around badass with some steamy romance scenes. I do wish he talked a bit more, but at the same time I like that part of his character. The scene where he was appearing to all of them without saying anything basically asking for help leading up to my favorite fight so far in this show was amazing. I like that all the other sensates knew what he needed. Plus that scene with Lila running her finger across him and licking the sweat off... <3

A: I loved that because they were just talking about Wolfie never asking for help.
