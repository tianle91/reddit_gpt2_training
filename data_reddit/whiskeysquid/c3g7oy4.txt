Title: Stuck in a bit of a life rut, any suggestions on what to do?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: Those things at the bottom of your legs? They're called feet. You can walk on them. It's the oldest form of transportation on the planet. Use it. My recommendation is stop fucking whining, stop being a victim, take ownership of your life and stop blaming other things. Your life is what you made it. Until you do that your life will never change.

A: I've walked to and from work for the little less than 2 months my car was away, getting rides home every now and then. School was just too far. I don't think I'm whining, just looking for some suggestions on how to get my act together.
