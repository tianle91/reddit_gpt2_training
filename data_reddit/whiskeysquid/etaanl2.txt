Body: This daily thread is a place for smaller discussion and quick questions. Moderation will be more relaxed in here but remember to be nice to your fellow Legends!

Q: What do you think?
A: Beside the code leaf errors, I'm really enjoying ranked matches. Just got to silver and every match takes forever and is very intense once it gets down to the final 3.
