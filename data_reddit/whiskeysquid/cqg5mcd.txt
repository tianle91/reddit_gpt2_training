Q: What do you think?
A: The jealousy consumed me. The anger shrouded over me like a blanket of pure rage. Why can't I find love? What is so wrong with me that there is not one woman on the entire planet destined to be mine forever? Millions of thoughts filled my head as I stood from my knees, covered in a red sea of blood from head to toe. I spent years traveling the country in hopes destiny would change and I too would have my soul mate. But that time never came. "I'm sorry." I sighed as I walked to the door of the abandoned building in the farmlands of North Carolina. I took one last look behind me at the countless number of lifeless lovers piled in a corner. "It's all over, Stanford! Come out with your hands up and surrender peacefully!" Cops. Cops everywhere. All I wanted was someone to spend my life with. Someone to love. Maybe someday. Yeah, someday. "He's got a gun, fire!"
