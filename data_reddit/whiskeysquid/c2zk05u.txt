Title: A question I never dared to ask regarding sex scenes in movies

Body: I've always been that kid living trough that awkward moment when watching a movie together with my parents and a nude woman was to be seen, or, sex was had.
The last thing I would have screamed in such a moment was "Are they doing it for real"?

I haven't seen many movies with sex scenes, neither full-on nor implied, just doesn't seem to cross my prefered genre But there are some movies where I really ask myself, there is no way they are faking it, isn't there?

Topless? Kissing? One body is hiding the other? Alright, we either cut to the "morning after" or use good camera angles, they probably don't even have to lose underwear if done right.
But there are some movies where this doesn't seem to be the case. So what happens? Shoving it somewhere else? This happens quite often in Korean cinema it seems. Camera angles that sort of imply that there is no one penetrating a bag instead.
Then there are of course movies like Brown Bunny where there is no way to fake it.

Is this an odd question to raise? Are the actors who do such thing just very open minded? Luckily not to be in a relationship? Or are there even cases where boyfriends allowed there acting girlfriends to have sex for a role?
Or are 99,999% of these cases, even the one where it really seems to be real (visibly no panties) just good acting?
What scenes are there where it is known that real penetration occured (asking it this way the whole question really sounds silly).


**tl;dr**
How many sex scenes are real?

[edit] Of course movies which are not marketed as (softcore) porn are meant.

Q: What do you think?
A: I remember thinking the same thing watching Monsters Ball where Billy Bob and Halle Berry go at it. "Do you think they're really fuckin'?" That's what I so nonchalantly blurted out infront of my ex gf at the time. I wonder why she broke up with me..lol
