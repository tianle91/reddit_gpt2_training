Title: Tyler Bate just wrestled a six man tag as a member of both teams

Body: Just happended at OTT. Match was originally advertised as British strong style vs Angel Cruz and two others, but during the show they showed a video of Bate talking with Angel Cruz as if they were partners. The whole match was Bate trying to decide which team to choose. He eventually chose the BSS lads. Amazing.

A: Opinions are subjective. How can someone competing in a sporting event be part of the two opposing teams? Lebron doesn't get to figure out which team he is going to be part of during game 2 today. And a wrestling show is about a fictional sporting event grounded in the real world. opinions are subjective. Facts is truth.
