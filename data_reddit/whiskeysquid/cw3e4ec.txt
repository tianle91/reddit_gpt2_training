Q: What do you think?
A: 'He fooled us all. Every single one of us, including myself. Clark Kent. Superman. He rid the world of evil and put an end to any future catastrophic disasters to come from space. The planet was finally safe and the people of earth rejoiced. Didn't last long. He..it started big. The president was the first to go. The Kyrptonian declared his rule of planet earth with little resistance. The small amount that did resist didn't last long. He plans to reborn Krytpon and rule the galaxy as the strongest being to live and rule over the strongest planet. There was a war between heroes and villains which all ended the same. With Him hovering over a wartorn battlefield enjoying the demise of his victories. The justice league fell hard. It only took him a year to take us down. I've been sheltered for many years. I know Superman. I know his weakness. After studying him these past years I've learned a lot more. And with the risky help of an unlikely ally, I will bring order back to this world. Most importantly I will bring justice to Kal'el. I am the night. I am Batman." The caped crusader lowered the pen used to write his possible last note. He turned to his ally and nodded. "You ready?" "Ha. Ha. Ha."
