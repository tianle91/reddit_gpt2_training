Title: 00 impala sway bar problem

Body: There's a pipe i thought was the sway bar that snapped, someone told me ut wasnt the sway so idk what it can be. Pipe connects from the tire to another bar. Any idea what it can be? I can provide pic if needed 

Q: What do you think?
A: Is it in the front or back wheels? Could be part of the control arm assembly. You should take a picture and post that.
