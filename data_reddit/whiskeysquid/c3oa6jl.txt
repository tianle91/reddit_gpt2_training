Title: That awkward moment that triggers a wrestling related memory.

Body: So I'm currently sitting next to my step dad in the hospital. I can't help but imagine Stone Cold walking in the room and hitting someone with a bed pan. This has to happen to people more often than I imagine. Like attending a funeral and just waiting for the reanimated corpse of the Big Bossman to show up and drag the casket across the cemetery. Which happens to me. Every time. Any more situations out there?

Q: What do you think?
A: Whenever I'm working (I work at a gas station..) and the radio has a real catchy song and the perfect timing when a customer walks in I just imagine pyro hitting and them walking to the ring.
