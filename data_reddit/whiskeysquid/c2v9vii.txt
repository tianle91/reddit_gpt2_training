Title: Do you think technical wrestling has vanished? 

Body: Its been years I missed some technical exhibition like
Chris Benoit,Kurt Angel,William Regal.
People who started wtaching wrestling since past two years may dont even know whats a suplex exept superplex.
Sure high flying style does exists but Its just chain wrestling that used to mesmerize me.
Well I am not a Cena fan but he does kind of portray this technicality.


Q: What do you think?
A: Punk, Del Rio, Bryan, Ziggler even Cody Rhodes sometimes throw in a little of it but no where near where it once was.
