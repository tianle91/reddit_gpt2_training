Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm not sure why this is blowing up so quick. Im not the most up to date with hip hop but im pretty sure funk volume been throwing disses to everyone, even havinh soljia boi respond. Where's their cred?

A: Funk Volume are irrelevant though. Kendrick did this when he's the top young talent in the game and went after all the heavy hitters including the entire New York scene. The only responses Hopsin got were from The Jokerr and Soulja Boy and he struggled to hold his own against them.

A: He had a beef with Novy Novak but thats kinda irrelevant too. I know soljia boi was aware if him but has he put out a diss track im not sure? I just think hopsin delivers really good and in my opinion definitely smoother than Kendrick
