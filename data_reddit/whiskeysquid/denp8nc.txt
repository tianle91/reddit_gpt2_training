Q: What do you think?
A: I haven't had a smoke since my best friend's funeral in November of 2016. I just started a new job which barely pays the rent and everyone there smokes. Just wondering if anyone has advice on how to keep off em.

A: I'm in the middle of trying to quit. I find chewing gum or keeping mints handy are crazy helpful for cravings. I prefer the fruit tic tacs. Hope it goes well for you. Its not easy but it will feel damn satisfying once we get through the rough patch. Good luck!
