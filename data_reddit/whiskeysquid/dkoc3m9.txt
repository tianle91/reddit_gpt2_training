Title: What is the shittiest city you've visited only once and completely refuse to return?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I've heard of WAY too many people who go out of their way to tour my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania because it's the setting for "The Office" sitcom. Only problem is, Scranton is known for three things: political corruption, crippling debt, and "The Office." They didn't even *film* the show here, just the establishing shots for the intro. Needless to say, they all wasted their time (and mine by tying up traffic).

A: You poor bastard. I grew up not too far away and I have a friend who still lives there. Only ventured up that way to go to the Sonic. Not a great place. Unless you like Latin gangs, I guess. But hey! You guys got a season of Cops recently I heard, so you know, you got that going.

A: Ironically crime went down for a brief moment once everyone knew about that.
