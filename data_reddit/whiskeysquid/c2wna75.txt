Title: What's YOUR theme song?

Body: The lights dim, a spotlight sets it focus on the stage, you begin your approach to the ring...what song rings out as your masculine figure bestows the arena with your awesome stage presence? 

Me: [Warriors of the World United - Manowar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHhE9_y76hw)

Q: What do you think?
A: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCeTe27OAZk I think it would be catchy and grab the attention of the audience. When I was younger I wanted to try to get into the local wrestling scene but was always too awkwardly shy to pursue it. This was always my theme when my friends and I would write our own storylines lol.
