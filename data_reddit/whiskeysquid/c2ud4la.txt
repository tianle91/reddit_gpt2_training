Title: My boyfriend puts his friends over me, am I overreacting?

Body: He is always hanging out with/ texing his friends. Guys and girls. It makes me feel left out because he doesn't spend as much time with just me, or include me with his friends. I talked to him about it and he said he wouldn't do that anymore, but it's just kept happening...what should I do?

Q: What do you think?
