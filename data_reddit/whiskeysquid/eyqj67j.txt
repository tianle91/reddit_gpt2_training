Title: Daily Discussion | September 01, 2019

Body: This daily thread is a place for smaller discussion and quick questions. Moderation will be more relaxed in here but remember to be nice to your fellow Legends!

Q: What do you think?
A: Weirdest thing happened last night. I was playing with 2 randos and was the champion squad going into the game. Mid game it cuts to the loading screen and goes into the legend select screen with the same randos i was with. We weren't champion squad going in but when we got the jumpship there was only 7 squads in game and the circle reset so us 7 squads had the entire map to loot. Never seen or heard this happening before.

A: Just happened to me. Glad to see I’m not the only one

A: It was strange. My team didn't have mics so I couldn't even discuss with then. Truly one of the most strange glitches I've come across
