Q: What do you think?
A: It would be nice to see Kane finally win a Rumble but I just can't see it happening. I thought up something along the lines of Daniel Bryan cashing in his briefcase sometime before the rumble but loosing. Then have Bryan win the rumble and go on to Wrestlemania and win the title. A man could dream..

A: That's what I've been saying, but just a little different. I've been saying that Bryan will lose the MITB briefcase to Alberto at the Rumble, then make a surprise entrance and win the whole thing. Bryan will go for CM Punk's WWE championship at Wrestlemania, and win it. Alberto comes out, and loses. Bryan gets his revenge and the MITB's streak is over.

A: That does sound pretty sweet
