Title: What's something you did as a kid that was so bad, you haven't told your parents to this day?

Q: What do you think?
A: I was at my cousins house when we were both 12 I believe. Me and him for some reason started to light random things on fire and throw them out the window. We even had local kids across the street cheering us on so we took an empty 2 liter Pepsi bottle and sprayed a ton of perfume in it and when we lit it, flames spewed out like a flamethrower and it startled us so we chucked it out the window and seconds later the other kids ran away. We didn't think anything of it until about five minutes later out mother came running upstairs and dragged us outside because the garage was on fire. Police and firemen came an questioned us and even those kids but no one said anything. I'm sure they found all the things we set in fire and told our parents but we never spoke of it.
