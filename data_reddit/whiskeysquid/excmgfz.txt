Title: What in the world Respawn? With what is going on with the loot boxes this game still has tons of problems...

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: This happened to my squadmate the other day. We grabbed his banner and respawned him and he died immediately when he landed. Respawned him again, same thing happened. So we just used his banner to keep getting rid of the beackns and he kept dying.
