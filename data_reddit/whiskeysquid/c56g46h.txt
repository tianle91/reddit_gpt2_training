Title: Songs about loneliness?

Body: Hey reddit, I've been listening to a lot of music lately. I really like Adam's Song, Creep, and A Better Place a Better Time. I was wondering if anyone could give me some songs about being alone. Most of the songs I find are about being lonely after a relationship has ended; however, I've never been in one, so I was wondering if there were any songs that fit my pathetic position. I don't really like hard rock too much, I'm looking for more late Green Day and late blink182 style songs. Whatever you can find, though, is fine with me. Thanks!
**TL;DR** Looking for songs about loneliness, none talking about having previous relationships

Q: What do you think?
A: Or just listen to "Hit the Switch" by Bright Eyes. It's a wonderful song.

A: Landlocked blues and First day of my life are good too. Pretty much everything Conner Oberst makes is beautiful. ;)
