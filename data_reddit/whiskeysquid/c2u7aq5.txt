Title: New New World Order - for Survivor Series

Just threw this picture together watching RAW. It makes more sense than you would think. It's actually very similar (if it turns out this way) to a storyline that I have written.

It is that the people clamoring that there is a conspiracy, ARE the conspirators all along. They are the agents of change and control whilst creating the illusion that they are at the mercy of the problem. 

What better group fits this than the NWO?

Q: What do you think?
A: I like it. I don't think Punk would be a heel though but the way the writers are throwing things together anymore who knows lol.
