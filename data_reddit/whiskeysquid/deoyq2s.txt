Title: [TOMT] [Movie] Movie with black guy on farm

Body: A movie where a black older man lives on a farm and is forced to take care of a young (probably 8 years old) Asian girl. He is very cold at first but warms up to the girl.  He is alone on the farm with his animals including chickens and dogs and cats and when the little girl first gets there she asks the man what the dog's name is and he says it's name is Dog. There's a black truck. It probably came out in early 2000s and I think it had American in the title. 

Q: What do you think?
A: Missing in America? Danny Glover is in it
