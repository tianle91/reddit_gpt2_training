Title: [TOMT][Game] Playstation 1 Shooting game with driveable vehicles and split screen

Body: Hey folks. Like the title says, I'm looking for a game that was on the PS1. All I can really remember is that it was a shooting game and there were maybe 4 types of vehicles you can drive. The game was military style and I think it was fairly realistic. And I think there was a snow level in the multiplayer. I think it was a third person shooter, but I'm not certain.

I know it's not much to go on, but thanks anyways for whatever help you can give me!

Q: What do you think?
