Title: You must decide your next friendship based on a strangers movie review - What would be the movie? 

Body: Rules to the game

You are allowed to ask a total stranger to review a movie of your choice

They are only allowed to review it and nothing else

Their review is the deciding factor of if you will ever hang out again

What movie would you choose for them to review?


I was asked this by a friend recently and I am not sure if I have come to the perfect answer. I have narrowed it down to Adaptation so far. I think it requires a certain amount of intelligence and humor to "get". It is a polarizing movie but I have found myself getting along with anybody who loves this movie. Your turn...

Q: What do you think?
A: V for Vendetta
