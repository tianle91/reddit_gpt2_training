Title: Gray wolves in Wyoming were being shot on sight until we forced the courts to intervene. Now Congress wants to strip these protections from wolves and we’re the lawyers fighting back. Ask us anything!

Body: Hello again from Earthjustice! You might remember our colleague Greg from his [AMA on bees and pesticides](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3l2tbr/im_an_attorney_for_the_beekeeping_industry_who/). We’re Tim Preso and Marjorie Mulhall, attorneys who fight on behalf of endangered species, including wolves. Gray wolves once roamed the United States before [decades of unregulated killing](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-wolf-that-changed-america-wolf-wars-americas-campaign-to-eradicate-the-wolf/4312/) nearly wiped out the species in the lower 48. Since wolves were reintroduced to the Northern Rockies in the mid-90s, the species has started to spread into a small part of its historic range. 

In 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) decided to remove Wyoming’s gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act and turn over wolf management to state law. This decision came despite the fact that Wyoming let hunters shoot wolves on sight across 85 percent of the state and failed to guarantee basic wolf protections in the rest. As a result, [the famous 832F wolf](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/science/earth/famous-wolf-is-killed-outside-yellowstone.html?_r=0), the collared alpha female of the Lamar Canyon pack, was among those killed after she traveled outside the bounds of Yellowstone National Park. We challenged the FWS decision in court and a judge [ruled in our favor](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2014/victory-for-wolves-in-wyoming). 

Now, politicians are trying to use backroom negotiations on government spending to reverse the court’s decision and again strip Endangered Species Act protections from wolves in Wyoming, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. This week, Congress and the White House are locked in [intense negotiations](http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/management/budget/2015/11/06/government-shutdown-could-still-lurk-budget-negotiations/75286682/) that will determine whether this [provision is included](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/259699-poison-pills-in-spending-bills-threaten-our-air-water) in the final government spending bill that will keep the lights on in 2016, due on President Obama’s desk by December 11. 

If you agree science, not politics should dictate whether wolves keep their protections, [please sign our petition to the president](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1809&_ga=1.222255199.677293821.1433786647).
