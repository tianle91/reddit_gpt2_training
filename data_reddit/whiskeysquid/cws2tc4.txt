Title: I'm looking for movies where the villain actually wins

Body: Like the title says. I'm tired of the cliche movies where the good guys always win, the good guy always gets the girl. I want something new, something that will surprise me.

Open to pretty much any category and release year.

**Edit:** Went from "Discussion" to "SPOILERS". Never knew this thread was going to blow up this much.

**Edit 2:** Not sure I regret asking this question or not.. holy shit I have 9000 comments to go through..

**Edit 3:** Thanks for the gold kind stranger! No idea what it does though..

**Edit 4:** Is this seriously the most discussed post on this sub reddit now? This has 9200+ replies and counting!



I wanted to thank everyone for giving me a bucket full of movies to watch. Unfortunately I can't really watch them all but I've selected a few movies to watch and a few to watch again that's been too long.

Q: What do you think?
