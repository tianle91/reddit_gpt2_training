Title: Best books to start reading?

Body: So I never really actually sat down and read an entire book from beginning to end. I want to start, especially with my new job where i have tons of time. And quite frankly I think movies are starting to get a little boring anymore so Reddit I ask you this, what books should I start out with?

Q: What do you think?
A: Depends on what you like? What kind of movies did you enjoy watching? drama, horror, science fiction, romance?

A: I like a mix of everything really, never really been into the sci fi thing though. Always liked movies that made me think about life or something of that matter.
