Title: Which wrestler(s) do you currently have "go home" heat for?

Body: Besides Cena of course. That's the obvious choice for some.

I would say Jack Swagger. I could go without seeing him in the ring again.

I can't take him seriously at all, especially considering Ziggler is so much better.

Q: What do you think?
A: All the former Nexus guys with the exception of Wade Barrett.
