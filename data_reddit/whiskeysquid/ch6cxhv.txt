Title: Found this big guy in the attic. Can someone identify for me/is it worth anything?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I was following those monsters on Ebay awhile back but they keep getting bid up over my personal five buck limit. They definitely have some value to collectors, /u/zcs90's estimate of $25 USD sounds about right. http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces20341.html "Notgeld" means that it was emergency token coinage (and sometimes bills) issued by a local authority, and not actual legal tender issued by the national government. There was a lot of that going on in Germany back then. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notgeld#Notgeld_during_the_German_hyperinflation It's definitely a cool piece. Don't clean it if you think anyone will ever want to sell it.
