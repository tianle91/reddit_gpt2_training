Title: Can the cluster understand each other when they see each other in person?

Body: If members of the cluster are in the same room and talking to each other, but using beta blockers, can they understand each other? The only reason they could understand each other at first was because they are in each others' heads and already know the language. But if they can't visit because of the blockers, can they understand the native languages of one another?

Q: What do you think?
A: I thought they couldn't see each other at all if they used the blockers

A: I mean if they're actually physically in the same room together. Like if Capheus went to Seoul, would he and Sun understand each other.
