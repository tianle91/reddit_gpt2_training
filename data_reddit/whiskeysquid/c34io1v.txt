Title: WWE Superstar of the Year Ballot

Body: **EVERYBODY READ FIRST**
-

I want this to be the most replied to post of all time. I want YOU to type in ONE, only ONE MALE AND FEMALE ~~SUPERSTAR ~~ WRESTLER from the WWE brand, that you want to be [/r/SquaredCircle](/r/SquaredCircle)'s top WWE Superstar of the Year.

Try not to vote superficially, like, for example, vote AJ out of her looks, instead of what she's done and stuff.

HERE ARE THE RULES

1. Only one vote per account. Try, out of pure honesty, not to use alt-accounts.

2. No multiple write-ins. The first Male and Female Wrestler's name you put in will be counted, any other that you list will be disregarded.

3. This thread will be CLOSED FRIDAY at 11:00 PM CST, where I will save this thread, delete it, and count each name myself. I'll put up a TOP 10 list the following day, to keep suspense and anticipation up.

4. Males and Females will be counted separately, obviously.

MODS, if you read this, can you do one of those notifications that F7U12 does above the front page, to notify everyone about this thread even after it falls of the front page, or put it in the sidebar?
