Title: What is your childhood memory that you thought was normal but realized it was traumatic later in your life?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: At my job i have a regular costumer who visits alot. Cool older dude, we spark a joint sometimes if it isnt busy. He told me the story of the monkey. His mom would chase him and his brother saying the monkey will get them if they don't get this done. She would make them eat Castro oil and give them enemas to cleanse them. Their dad would then wear a mask, proclaiming the monkey has arrived, and catch one kid and put them in a giant potato sack and walk around outside to make them think they were being taken. He told me he thought it was normal until he got to college and told the story in a group of friends talking about old habbits their parents used to do. It was then he realized it was not normal.
