Body: This daily thread is a place for smaller discussion and quick questions. Moderation will be more relaxed in here but remember to be nice to your fellow Legends!

Q: What do you think?
A: Played with 2 randoms in rank last night. Both wanted Wraith. When one didnt get it he started to roast the one who did about apparently paying all this money for the wraith heirloom stuff and how he had no life blah blah. The wraith turned out to be jumpmaster and dropped instantly. I broke off from the squad pretty quick and as soon as i did the wraith dropped themselves and the douche into the furthest part of the ocean. Sacrificed his Gold rp just to get his justice.
