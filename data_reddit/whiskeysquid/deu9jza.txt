Title: [discussion] Name a movie that you saw and thought "Man I want to read the book version of this!"

Body: Doesn't have to just be a movie btw (tv show, videogame etc). I Always enjoy the books that are made into movies because they give me more insight to that world and the characters involved. My choice would be Edgar Wright's Baby Driver. Just watched the trailer and need to see more of that world. 

Q: What do you think?
A: The Road
