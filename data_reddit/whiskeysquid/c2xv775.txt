Title: Team Orton v Team Barrett at Survivor Series.

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: It's like wwe creative was just like, "okay, lets take all the regulars from raw and smackdown who got nothing else going at the moment and throw them in a match". Obvious Orton will be the one remaining. I'd really like to see Rhodes eliminate him though and him and Barrett the last 2 reamining.
