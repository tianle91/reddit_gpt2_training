Title: What was your first "mature" movie you saw as a kid?

Body: What was your first serious movie you ever saw? Me it was Reign of Fire (Not that serious but hey), I was 8 and it scared the living shit out of me. I did saw other non-kid movie like Star Wars and stuff but this was my first serious movie.

Q: What do you think?
A: Tales from the Hood. Those damn Voodoo dolls kept me up many of nights.
