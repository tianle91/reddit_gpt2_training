Body: I'm going with Dan Brown. Yes, his plots are the same and predictable, but sometimes I want a fun read.

A: Jake Bible. He's done some pretty interesting zombie apocalypse books. Zburbia is a series I have gotten really into and recommend to anyone interested in those types of stories. On a side note if anyone has interesting post apocalyptic books they'd like the recommend I'd be all ears!
