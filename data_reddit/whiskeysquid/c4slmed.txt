Q: Any crazy stories, like weird customers or events?
A: Tons and tons. One that stands out the most mainly because it happened on my first week: Me and the kid I worked with at the time were both on register and this really attractive slutty dressed girl comes in stumbling and goes to the bathroom. About twenty minutes or so she comes out and walks over to my register with a box of trident gum and as I'm ringing her out she pulls her phone out and starts giggling. She then says "Wanna see something funny" and im like sure, so she shows me a picture of her naked in our bathroom. She kept laughing and went on t osay "I pretty much made your night huh" And left after paying for the gum. Will never forget.
