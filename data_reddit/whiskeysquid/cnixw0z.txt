Q: no ragrats
A: Okay Tommy Pickles

Q: Okay Tommy Pickles
A: Everyone knows Phil and Lil were the ones that grew up to be stoners. Actually, now that I think about it, Tommy's parents always seemed really chill. I'm sure Stu Pickles is the kind of guy that rolls up a joint he secretly smokes in the backyard. His wife kind of nags so it makes sense. [Also this.](http://i.imgur.com/EkpcN.jpg)

A: Chucky also

Q: Chucky also
A: I feel as if Chuckie would be a pill popper but be on the low about it. Them his sister would catch him and tell the dad and his dad wud be like "Chuckie you gotta stop your hurting not only yourself but everyone around you" so he tries stop but catches tommy making out with Lil who Chuckie was dating at the time and he tries Beating up dill for revenge but accidentally kills him and he hides the body but he started up on the pills again and he was so faded he tried burying him in their old sandbox where the pickles still lived and stu sees and he's like DILL!! And Chuckie panics and shoots stu cuz chucky got a gun from Angelica who was hustling now and he gets scared af so he shoots himself to end it all :/
