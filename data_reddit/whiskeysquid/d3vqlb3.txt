Title: [TOMT][Chatroom] Looking for People I RP'd With on AOL's Red Dragon Inn Chatroom >12 Years Ago

Body: Hey! 
I read the rules and there was nothing I noticed that banned asking about people, so for awhile now I have been trying to find a particular guy/person I use to RP with in the Red Dragon Inn chatroom back when AOL was a thing that existed and had chatrooms. 

I'm still fairly close to some people I met there, but after losing internet for awhile due to crappy situations at home, I never was able to find the guy with the username Vid_gamr_Str 

I had a few cringe worthy usernames I used back then (pre-teen girl with *feelings*) but the two I used the most were icemoonhiku and DarkDragoon803 (or 903, I can't remember specifically) 

Anyway, if this is not allowed I apologize. 
If there is a better reddit/resource for this question I would love to know it. My detective skills are not super strong. 

Thanks!
