Title: Recommend a TV show to watch :)

Body: My husband and I just finished Merlin BBC and feel lost with nothing to watch.

I have already seen: 

1. Breaking Bad
2. The Walking Dead
3. Firefly
4. Mad Men
5. Doctor Who
6. Supernatural
7. Sherlock (BBC)
8. Dexter
9. How I Met Your Mother
10. American Horror Story
11. Fringe
12. All Star Trek 

I'm sure I've forgotten some, but it at least gives an idea of what my taste is, but I am open to anything. :)

(Ones I don't like because of writing style are Parks and Rec, Burn Notice, and Arrested Development)

Edit: Added numbers to my list because I'm too dumb to figure out how to make bullet points >.<

Q: What do you think?
A: United states of tara was good and unique.
