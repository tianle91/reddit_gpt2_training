Title: [TOMT][Commerical][90's] A commercial I vaguely remember from when I was a kid

Body: I can only assume it was a shoe commercial. I remember it was animated and possibly and old grumpy woman yelling "EAT MY SHOE".

Q: What do you think?
A: Sounds like Married with Children, but its a show, not a commercial.
