Q: What do you think?
A: Arrested Development, Bojack Horseman, Flaked, and Netflix Live. Is Will Arnett the face of Netflix? I'm very happy with this.

A: Is Flaked worth a watch?

Q: Is Flaked worth a watch?
A: It's worth a shot I think. Will Arnett is a down on his luck type, recovering alcoholic, *cough bojack cough* who tries not to be an asshole but fails sometimes. He plays that roll very well, some heartwarming stuff thrown in too. Some people find it too depressing. Kinda depends on what you want out of the show, if you want something purely lighthearted then you might not like it. Overall, very solid show, would recommend.
