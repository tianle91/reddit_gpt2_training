Title: Reddit, if you could pick 2 characters/people to be your best bros who would you pick?

Body: I'd pick Sol from Pineapple Express (James Franco) and Andrew.W.K. 

Q: What do you think?
A: Charlie (from IASIP) and Ryan Gosling. The Antics Charlie would get us in would be hilarious and the money from Gosling would make the antics work better plus the women he must hang with..yes.
