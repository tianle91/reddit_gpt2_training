Title: Gf broke up with me tonight after almost 3 years. 

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: 1) Go to your trustworthy friends - spill your guts, get shit-faced, break shit, etc. 2) Cry like a little baby - IN PRIVATE. 3) Next weekend, pick up some randy tart and sport fuck her. Continue having as much meaningless sex as necessary to get your ex's stink off of you. 4) Spend some time officially single. 5) Party some more. 6) Bang some more chicks. 7) Several months down the road, consider dating "for real" again. **GOOD AS NEW!**
