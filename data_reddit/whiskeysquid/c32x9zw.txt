Title: A question for anyone who has WWE '12...

Body: ...can you create your own stable? And if so, how in-depth is the customization?

Q: What do you think?
A: If you set a custom song from your hard drive on a CAW, can the person you're wrestling online hear it during the entrance? Hated that you were stuck with the wrestlers theme songs, kind of kills the experience in your CAW online.
