Title: So, I'm not sure if it has been posted or not but...What are your favorite/least favorite entrance themes and why??

Body: I have always loved the Undertaker's entrance as a whole. But as for theme's I have quite a few...

(No Real Order)

Hulk Hogan(Real American) - Just fits him so well -

The Ultimate Warrior - Shit is going down -

The Rock - More shit is going down -

Stone Cold - Shit just got Real -

Chris Jericho(present theme) - Again it fits him so well -

Edge(present) - Gets me crazy pumped -

DX - Most shit is going down


Q: What do you think?
A: I always hated MVP's enterance, between the music and that inflatable tunnel thing. horrible. Stone Colds will always be a classic. I liked Benoits. Dolph Zigglers fits him so perfect too, probably one of the best at the moment.
