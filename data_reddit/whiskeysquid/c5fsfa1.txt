Title: The ex gf I still kind of love but haven't talked to rationally in months is coming over in 3 hours, what do i do

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: You've still got feelings for her, so sleeping with her is going to cause you HUGE DRAMA. Tell her you miss her too, but she has a boyfriend now. Do you want some dude's sloppy seconds? Normally I'd be the "bone her" guy, but not this situation. Good luck!

A: Well technically wouldn't the boyfriend be my sloppy seconds?
