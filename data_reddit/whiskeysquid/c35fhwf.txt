Title: You book the match endings.

Body: Okay, so I want to start by saying that I usually hate the corny, terrible, match endings like Cena vs Batista last man standing where Cena taped Batista to the ring post, and won, but...yeah

Match endings to me can make or break the match.  If it's a great and super amazing match, but the ending is terrible you feel cheated, but it can also save a bad match is the ending was good.

I've had this match ending in my head for a while now, and the Royal Rumble isn't that far away:

1.  Royal Rumble starts out with say Santino and Jay Uso (this doesn't matter)

2. The 3rd persons time ticks down, and you hear "You know, I got ya, yeah--one; break the walls down" big pop from the crowd, but no Jericho.

3.  Match continues, and Big Show & Kane form an alliance (this works since they were together before the Hall of Pain hit)

4.  Kane or Show wins, and the winner celebrates, the ref calls for the bell raises his arm, confetti falls...whatever.

5.  He steps over the top rope and exits the ring like the normal big guys do, and walks up the ramp and into the back.

6.  Jericho comes out from under the ring, ref recalls decision, and Jericho is laughing and smiling pointing to his head, and is holding a smart phone with the ppv streaming (from wwe.com of course).

7. fade to black.

What are some match ending ideas that you've come up with?

Q: What do you think?
A: I'd love Jericho to return at the Rumble but I wouldn't want him to win it. Personally I don't like when a wrestler makes a return at the rumble to win. I like to see the guy build up momentum going towards it then winnning like Del Rio did. Not like Edge the year before.
