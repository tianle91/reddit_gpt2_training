Title: Okay, r/movies, give me your 15 favorite movies. Favorite, not best.

Body: Fifteen favorite movies, no ranking necessary. I'm asking this for the same reason I love large "best movies" lists: I don't care about the ranking, I'm looking for awesome films I haven't seen. Yeah, there might be a lot of Fight Clubs, but that one "Spirit of the Beehive" will make it all worthwhile. Bonus points if people want to reply with recommendations based on someone's list.

My favorite films would be:
Eraserhead,
Boogie Nights,
Stardust Memories,
Miller's Crossing,
Rushmore,
Jesus' Son,
Reservoir Dogs,
Die Hard,
The Grand Illusion,
The Killing,
Children Of Men,
Life Of Brian,
Broadway Danny Rose,
High and Low,
The Conversation
