Title: My boyfriend puts his friends over me, am I overreacting?

Body: He is always hanging out with/ texing his friends. Guys and girls. It makes me feel left out because he doesn't spend as much time with just me, or include me with his friends. I talked to him about it and he said he wouldn't do that anymore, but it's just kept happening...what should I do?

Q: What do you think?
A: My girlfriend actually just confronted me about the same thing. She had to threaten to break up with me if it continued because when she'd say something about it before I would say she's overreacting and it's no big deal. Only when she told me she'd leave me if it continued did I realize how big of a deal it was. The important thing was she made sure to let me know she wasn't making me choose between her and my friends but made it clear that she just wanted to be involved more which I began to do and its better now. So put some scare in him, don't make him choose. Hope it helps lol
