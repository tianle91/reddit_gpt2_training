Title: Are there small spaces to rent in Queens? For the purpose of board games video gaming

Body: I was just wondering if any of you know any places where I can rent a spot for me and my buddies to hang out at with tables and chairs that's not too expensive. Our collective homes are just too small to accommodate the amount of guests we'd like to invite :)

Q: What do you think?
A: I smell illegal gambling here

A: Not really, more like very nerdy things like Magic the Gathering, Zombies and Cards against Humanity and Werewolf.
