Title: Quick question about "Drive"

Body: I'm just curious to know if you and your friends liked it. I loved it. Thought every part of it was great. But out of all the people I know that have seen it, I am the only one who didn't hate it. I'm very confused and would like reddit's input. Thanks!

Q: What do you think?
A: Every movie I've ever seen with Ryan Gosling in it I hated. I was dragged to see it with a friend who had a gift card to the theaters and man am I glad I went. From that intense elevator scene to the amazing soundtrack it was an all around great movie and my buddy liked it as well.
