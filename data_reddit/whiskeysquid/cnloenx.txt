Title: What's the one match you would show someone to make them a wrestling fan?

Body: Mine would be this.
What's yours?

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrkluv_09-prince-devitt-vs-pac-njpw-06-06-12_sport wouldn't show this because commentary is in different language  
10/10 would show them this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efVeGG1vRUg 

Q: What do you think?
A: I actually showed a friend of mine who was on the fence about wrestling the shield vs Wyatt's match at elimination chamber and he has been a fan ever since.
