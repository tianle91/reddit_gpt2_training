Title: 00 impala sway bar problem

Body: There's a pipe i thought was the sway bar that snapped, someone told me ut wasnt the sway so idk what it can be. Pipe connects from the tire to another bar. Any idea what it can be? I can provide pic if needed 

Q: What do you think?
A: Is it in the front or back wheels? Could be part of the control arm assembly. You should take a picture and post that.

A: That isn't the sway bar that's snapped. The sway bar is near the top of this photo: you can see it coming out of the top of the wheel, curving back towards the camera, then running off to the left through a small bracket + bushing. It's a rear tie rod that's snapped. See here, it's #8: http://www.newgmparts.com/parts/2000/CHEVROLET/IMPALA/?siteid=213815&vehicleid=1358030&diagram=NHP080 This should be replaced ASAP, as your wheel's gonna be out of alignment otherwise... not only will your tire start wearing away rather quickly, your car's handling could become unsafe: you could spin out much easier. You'll need an alignment once this part is replaced, too.
