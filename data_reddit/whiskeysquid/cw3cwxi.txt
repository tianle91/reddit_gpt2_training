Q: What do you think?
A: "I just couldn't get pass it. How does someone eat everything with a spoon? Pasta, steak, everything spoon, spoon, spoon!" Chandler became erratic and plopped down on couch of Central Perk. "Steak? With a spoon? Really?" George replied with an almost disgusted look on his face. Chandler's eyes grew larger and eyebrows perched up as he grunted. "What's with this place anyway? We're sitting on furniture drinking overpriced coffee we could be doing this at my place saving a whole 'lotta money I tell ya." George chuckled through his nose. Chandler leaned forward to the edge of his seat and looked to George. "I just don't know what's wrong with me. I finally had a smoking hot girl who I actually liked and something so dumb makes me run away in a panic." "Heh, I know the feeling buddy. I'm the king of that feeling let me tell ya." Georges hopelessly tries to comfort Chandler. "Let's get outta here, too many memories of her here." Chandler and George rose from their seats and began to exit the coffee shop. "I know the best little place to get cheesecake to die for! You'll love it, it'll take ya mind right off Amber." George insisted. "Andrea." Chandler corrected him. "Ehh whatever." George replied.
