Title: What's your favorite part of ranked?

Body: My favorite part of ranked is getting in teams with 2 people in party chat. Love having zero communication.

Q: What do you think?
A: Being in the top 3, even top 4. I'm shit at the game but when you can make a really good play that impacts the game in a big way and even win the game, boy its hype.
