Title: [TOMT] Song with what I remember to be waves in the beginning

Body: Not exactly sure about the lyrics. I've heard it a few times but completely lost any sort of memory of it. The only things I can remember are the waves playing and it being a very melodic type of I guess it would be indie music. I believe its possible the word sands might be either in the song name or the band name.

Q: What do you think?
A: I really wish I could remember more about it. All I can remember is it was slow pace but had some fast parts I think
