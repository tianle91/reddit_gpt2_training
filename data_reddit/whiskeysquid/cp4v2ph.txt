Title: Just moved to the area

Body: Hello everyone I just recently moved to Queens and got a job. For someone who has no friends here yet, what's good to do around here? On that note any chances of an organized Reddit meetup in the area? 

Q: What do you think?
A: There's going to be a meetup on the 8th for the NYCFC game against Orlando: https://www.reddit.com/r/Queens/comments/2xu7kr/nycfc_season_opener_queens_meetup_38_austin/

A: Sounds cool. Not really a soccer fan but maybe I'll look into it just to get out of the house lol
