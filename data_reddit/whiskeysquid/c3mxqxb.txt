Title: Would you rather fight a clone of yourself or 100 2-inch tall clones of yourself?

Body: Help me resolve this argument with my friend

He insists the clone is the better answer, which I can't see at all

The clone would be just as strong as you, it'd all be down to whoever manages to pull something sneaky first

With 100 2-inch clones of yourself, there's not much they can really do

They would be tiny in comparison to you, and could probably be dealt with by stomping around a bit

So Reddit, what would you go for? And of course, explain why

Q: What do you think?
A: Would the little clones have the same mind set I have now? If so I'd fight the full sized clone because If i was 2 inches tall and had 199 more of me i'd be crawling into all sorts of holes ripping shit up.
