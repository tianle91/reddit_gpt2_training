Title: I am a McDonald's employee. Crew member, mostly night shift. AMA!

Body: I'm just a simple crew member, started in Nov 2014. Just got out of high school last summer, wanted to make a little income, and here I am now. I work the fryers, the grills, and both the front counter and the drive thru. I also clean up the place.

Q: What do you think?
A: I used to work at a gas station third shift across the street from a mcdonalds. I would trade employees there who came to buy cigarettes on down time free smokes or something they needed or food and would even smoke me up on the side of the building (talking trees here). Anything fun like that by you?
