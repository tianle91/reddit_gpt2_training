Title: Funniest scene on the show?

Body: Frank recounting all of the gang's adventures when he was giving the riverboat tour might've been the funniest scene I've ever seen on the show. I was dying laughing and had to pause it half way through because I was in pain from laughing so hard and to collect myself. What other scenes do people think are the best from Always Sunny?

Q: What do you think?
A: I almost passed out laughing when I first seen this scene http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBnScNrk13Q
