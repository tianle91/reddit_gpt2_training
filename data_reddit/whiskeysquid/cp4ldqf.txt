In subreddit: Queens

Title: Just moved to the area

Body: Hello everyone I just recently moved to Queens and got a job. For someone who has no friends here yet, what's good to do around here? On that note any chances of an organized Reddit meetup in the area? 

Q: What do you think?
A: Welcome! What part of Queens are you in? It's a very diverse borough in terms of cultures and things to do, so knowing which neighborhood you're in and what you'd be interested in would be helpful.

A: I'm in Middle Village. Honestly I'd be satisfied with anything to keep me occupied when I'm not working. I've been looking into gyms in the area not really sure which one catches my eye though. Maybe a bar or something that shows basketball games. I'm into other recreational hobbies but it's not legal here :( lol. Are there any good music venues nearby? Any comedy clubs or something?
