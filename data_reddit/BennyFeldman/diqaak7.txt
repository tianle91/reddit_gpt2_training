Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: So do you do this (the tourette's) all the time even when people aren't around? What about while you sleep? Like does it only effect you in certain situations or is it all the time? Are you touretting right now? Sorry if that's too personal I'm just fascinated. Especially since it seemed like you mainly only struggled while taking a breath or in between jokes.

A: - Yes, but not nearly as bad off stage. It gets way worse when I am anxious / nervous / stressed, such as when I'm doing stand-up. - I have body tourette's in my sleep, but not vocal, which is neat - Other times it gets worse are when I have caffeine, sugar, or am in a heightened emotional state like being angry, or as I am initially sexually aroused lol. - I actually have breathing Tourette's! Sometimes I literally stop breathing for a solid thirty seconds randomly. - I am very mildly Touretting right now as I type this, just stuff like arm twitches and face, occasional bark or curse
