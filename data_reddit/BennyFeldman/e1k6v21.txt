A: Probably just a English thing, like fella or geeza. Along the lines of "what a guy" or "well done mate". "He's a good lad" means he's got a good heart in him. "He's such a lad" would mean more like lad culture (always drinking/chasing all the fit birds/on holiday in Ibiza/loves football etc). In your case, you did well and your set was funny especially when you incorporate your situation. Good on you, son (same principle as "lad")! :D
