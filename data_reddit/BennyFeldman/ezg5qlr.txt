Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Why do you think that those with tourettes latch onto profanity for their ticks specifically? I've always been curious on that.

A: I have absolutely no idea! Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, but I'm not sure why there even is a cursing type. I've been using the example that it's like stubbing your toe, and curse words are the only words that make sense to use in that moment. I think that part of my brain is randomly activated.
