Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: One of my best friends has Tourette's, and his manifests similarly to yours - head twitches and constant swearing - unless he is singing or counting. Watching this made me think of getting him into stand-up. He's a super funny guy, with a self-demeaning sense of humour. We are always in hysterics around him! Thanks for the inspiration. Keep it up

A: Heck yeah, tell him I said he should do it! Mine also goes away when I'm dancing for some reason, and I'm not entirely sure why, except that it might be from me focusing on my body. Thank you for the kind words!!
