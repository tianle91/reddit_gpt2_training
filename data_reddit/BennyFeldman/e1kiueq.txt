Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Do you know or feel when the tick is coming or no? Because you can clearly say longer sentences without tick's interruption? Anyway's great performance, keep up the good job! Surf's up! (what the fuck does that even mean?)

A: I’m not Benny, but my understanding is that it is kind of like a sneeze. You can hold it off for a little bit but it is extremely uncomfortable. Eventually, you have to let it loose to release the pressure.

A: Correct! I think the best metaphor is blinking, where you usually just blink without thinking about it, but you can hold your eyes open for short periods of time if you need to, but holding them open for a full five minutes is super difficult.
