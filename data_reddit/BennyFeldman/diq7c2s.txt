Q: What do you think?
A: I love how we pretend that this guy is funny just because he has tourettes. But stolen one-liners are hilarious. (?)

A: I wonder how much he embellishes his disorder for the show

A: Slightly copy pasta from another response: I don't actively embellish. I let it happen when I am on stage, so I don't try to hold it back. The issue with holding it back would be that it would build up and then come out all at once. But, by letting it happen, I'm able to release the tension preemptively so it doesn't get even worse. I do have significantly less Tourette's when I am relaxed and not on stage in front of people telling jokes, so the nerves play a large part in amping up the tics.
