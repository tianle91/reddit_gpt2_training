Q: What do you think?
A: Honestly, I can see this going places. Keep working on the material and I think the rest will fall in place naturally. Do you have a YouTube channel? I definitely want to watch the progress.

A: Thank you!! That's very kind, I'm working on it. The video is on my channel, which is just ol' [Benny Feldman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and I got two other videos on there as well. I actually previously posted both of them to Reddit, one a year ago, and the other 2 years ago.
