Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Loved the set! I also love that you embrace the Tourette’s. Your confidence is hot. Just wondering... I’m not sure what your relationship status is now, but how have you found dating with Tourette’s?

A: Thank you! Also lol, I appreciate that, that's a very bold compliment. I am currently single, but I haven't really found Tourette's to be any sort of real issue while dating. Most people get used to it pretty quickly, and once I get comfortable around someone, it significantly decreases.
