Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. What's a bigger disability, the Tourette's or the mustache?

Q: What do you think?
A: expected the ticks to distract a lot from the jokes at the start, but it was actually pretty good, and I like how you worked some of the ticks into the humour ("two huh's" etc.)

A: Thank you!! I'm glad it wasn't distracting, I'm able to basically hold most of the tension of the tics while telling a joke, and then release it between, so I get into a sort of back & forth rhythm with it. There's a few specific like tic types that I have very often, so I end up doing a lot of the same or similar riffs
