Q: What do you think?
A: I don’t usually laugh at stuff when I’m sitting at home by myself but I audibly laughed at a few of those. I can tell you have to flow with the tics, but you incorporate them well. Funny stuff man. Dog park joke is spot on.

A: Thank you! If I'm sitting at home perusing through some memes, I usually just gently exhale out of my nose to laugh, so I really appreciate that

A: You made me spit up some 15 year old whiskey when you said “that’s what the note said”. I love your integration of tics into the set. Also when I do come see your show you owe me a shot. You are great.
