Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: My wife and I laughed our asses off. Every joke. (Although admittedly the riff was funnier lol) Great delivery. It makes me wonder about the concept of comedic timing, and its impact on the audience's reception. You're having to work against a very difficult circumstance that affects what is considered a fundamental component of comedy...and had me in stitches. I really hope you keep it up, and have a fruitful career in comedy.
