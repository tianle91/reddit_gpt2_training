Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Dude, very funny. I loved the witches potion bit. I have a dumb question, does your neck get sore after a while?, it just seems like you're getting quite a work out. Also, does the twitch get worse when you're on stage? (stressed, under pressure, etc) ALSO, sorry, one more question, when does your twitch start in the morning? Is it literally as soon as you open your eyes or do you get a bit of a break before it starts?

A: Thank you!! It doesn't really get sore, but sometimes I pull the muscle in the back of my neck and that hurts a bunch lol. I've done that a few times on stage and had to pause for a while. The most sore I usually get is my face, I have a lot of tics where I scrunch up my eyes and nose. My tics are way worse on stage, or generally when I'm nervous/excited/stressed/anxious/etc. Doing stand-up is like an immediate shot of adrenaline, so it pretty much always makes it worse. When I wake up, I'm usually fairly relaxed, so I tend not to have many tics. I think that generally flips once I mentally start dealing with the shit I got to do at work, start talking to people, or once I have coffee lol.
