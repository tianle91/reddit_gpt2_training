Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: How often did you tic a day before your parents decided to seek a diagnosis? I've noticed recently my son has started to tic, but only 2-3 times a day. It is always random and it's always in a set pattern. I don't want to overreact by rushing him to the doctor's, but also don't want to be dismissive either.

A: We literally never went when I was a kid, we just assumed it was a nervous tic as opposed to Tourette's. I didn't finally go to the doctor until I started having full body shakes and head jerks, at the ripe old age of 21 edit: I would say no need to rush! See if it gets significantly in the way first
