Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.

A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.
