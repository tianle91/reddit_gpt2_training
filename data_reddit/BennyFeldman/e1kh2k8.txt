Q: What do you think?
A: This is very similar to Mitch Hedberg and while it's obviously funny and good, and you're working with the disability really intelligently, I would work on standing out as your own flow and feeling. Once I realized you sounded like Mitch Hedberg, it unfortunately was all I could think about until I began typing :(

A: Thank you, that's a very valid point, I need to make sure I don't cop his style! On the one hand, all of the jokes are definitely my own, so that's good, but I do definitely need to make sure I don't just lean into his delivery.
