Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Funny as hell man, love the authenticity. Like, in a short sentence, what kind of glitch does the brain do when the symptoms happen? Is there a thought(s) in midst of them as well or naw?

A: That's very kind, thank you!! The glitch is really more like a weird tension build up. You know when you hold your eyes open for a long time and you really want to close them? I think it's sort of like that, or like an itch. There's no particular thought that I associate with them, other than that physical sensation
