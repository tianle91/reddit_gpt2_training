A: Hahaaaaaha is it bad that I laughed hard at your ticks as well? You remind me of Stuart Francis but with this whole other dimension of physical comedy going on, sorry if I offended you

A: That's totally alright! I find them very funny as well. Sometimes audiences laugh at them from the get go, and I'm not a huge fan of that, I prefer when they get permission from me first in a way. Sort of like laughing at vs laughing with. Thank you though!! Stewart Francis is great, I love his long convoluted joke about his mom telling the other guys joke about the man who was like a sardine in oil.
