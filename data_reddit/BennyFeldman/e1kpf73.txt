Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Forgive me if it's been asked, I scrolled a lot and didn't see anything. What kind of verbal ticks did you have when you where younger? At what age did the swearing set in? Great set, I have always enjoyed great one-liners and you definitely fit that bill. Best wishes as you continue.

A: I started swearing in my tics around the age of 21, before that it was mostly just gentle humming noises from the ages of 7 to 21. Excessive throat swallowing was one as well Thank you!
