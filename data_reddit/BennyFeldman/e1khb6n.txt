Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I don't know a lot about tourettes but would there be a way to change the things you say when your tick goes off? Not that I condemn cussing cause I do the same but you might be able to add some unexpected surprise to your comedy routines if you started spouting random math theorems. As an aside, my favorite was the sun foodchain joke.

A: I can definitely steer somewhat, I try to say Shit and Fuck as opposed to worse words, like the N word, or cunt. Or I can steer it to be a different tic I already have, like a body tic. I can't go much further than that though, like I can't start saying "E = MC squared" or anything Thank you!
