Q: What do you think?
A: Post more content on your channel. There's a lot of less funny individuals doing pretty alright by posting "try hard"(super animated, borderline obnoxious) material. Your laid back, and genuine, approach sells the whole thing. At least for me, anyways. How often do you perform?

A: That's both very kind and solid advice, thank you!! I perform anywhere from one to three times a week, depending on shows and mics. I would love to post more videos, but it takes me a while to have a new five minutes that I'm excited to put out. I'm working on having a better turn around time though, and focusing on having better systems in place to do so.
