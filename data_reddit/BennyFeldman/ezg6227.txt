Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Do you ever fake ticks during a set? Sometimes they seem intentional and funny but I didn't want to laugh if it was a legitimate tick.

A: Nope! I get this question a lot actually, which makes sense. I absolutely let them happen though, like I don't hold them back between jokes, but I definitely never purposefully tic during a set. I think that's why it looks fake, because it's a clear pattern of me holding it during a joke, me ticcing, hold, tic, hold, etc. I have faked them in class before though! I was the only student who was allowed to get away with just yelling MOTHERFUCKER, so once in a while I would do it just for fun lol
