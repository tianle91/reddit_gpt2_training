Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Probably a little late to get a reply, but I myself have Tourette's, but however not as funny as you are. It's awesome to see someone else other than me that can take light of it. I'm definitely going to use some of your jokes now. I might at least a little more funny to my friends.
