Title: Need Help

Body: Hey, my name's CJ and I've had tourettes since I was 12. And OCD prevalent since I was born. I'm 17 now. However, at first I mistook my tics for compulsions because of my OCD. Once I developed coprolalia during my GCSE exams when I was 16, I then knew it wasn't compulsions. I've dealt with my OCD now, I take 200mg of sertraline and it works like my eighth wonder. I feel normal again. I feel human again. However, the tourettes is still here (the sertraline has made it slightly better 20% I guess you could say). I can't but help want to say the most graphic and gruesomely vivid things to people, especially the people I love and want to get to know. I tell my own mother I want to f**k her up the a**e, I tell random lasses and lads I want to murder them. I couldn't come into my film studies class today because I had an unbearably relentless and cold tic to say to this girl "I'm going to r**e you and then kill you" Yes I know, that's not a tic that people would laugh at. People won't think I'm the class clown anymore when that s**t comes spraying out like a flamethrower.

If anyone here suffers with coprolalia is this normal? Is this supposed to be this extreme and relentlessly violent. I've never seen any tourettes this graphic on TV or youtube or any form of media what so ever. Is there something extra, extra wrong with me? I told the girl I really like in my Drama that's shes a c**t. I was seconds away from saying I want to f**k her. It broke my heart into pieces because she is so beautiful and things just keeping coming to screw things up. I need help really badly. I love people and I've been lonely for my whole life. I've dealt with my OCD since the second I've came into this world and I thought that would be the end of it, I thought that I wouldn't be scared anymore but my brain has came for round two and I need your guys' help to bring this thing down. Please, I'm fine If I can't get rid of my tourettes, but I need to know my options. What techniques can I use? What medications are widely accepted? What are your guys' experiences with coprolalia or medication in general? Please help me out. I'm so drainingly lonely. Now my OCD has gone, I've never ever wanted to connect to people more than I do now. I wanted to kill myself and kill others before I got help, I was like a school shooter. I didn't know the difference between reality and fantasy and psychosis completely consumed me. I don't want to be dragged back to that dark place, I won't let it, not again. I will never hurt anyone anymore, I've done that enough. I know what it means to be alive now. I won't be suicidal again, I'm too in love with the world and life to give up on it, so please, just help me. I like this girl a lot and I want to show her.

Q: What do you think?
A: I have coprolalia as well, but my tics are mostly just strings of curse words. I'm not sure how much my experience will be relevant or helpful, since you seem to have more severe social based tics, but maybe something strikes. Most people know what Tourette's is, so usually if I tell them outright and apologize kindly, they are very understanding. However, sometimes if I say something like "faggot" even the people who know still take a moment to process it. I often then have to remind them, usually jokingly, like "hey, look, I don't actually mean the things I say, I have Tourette's." It's always a tough situation with new people or if the tic is really bad, but being open and honest about it seems to work well. I realize your tics may be harder to explain away simply, but consider (if you don't already) telling everyone you meet immediately that you have Tourette's and that it's a possibility. I do that currently and find it's very helpful. In terms of medicine, I was on Guanfacine for a while, which seemed to help. It was basically keeping my heart rate from going past a certain elevation, but that would hurt sometimes. I went off it and found that if I try to keep my heart rate down in other ways, like avoiding coffee and sugar spikes, the tics were more passive. I also have OCD and bouts of extreme aggression, not usually put into words though. Not sure if the aggression is OCD or Tourette's or how that works to be honest, but when it happens I usually like to find somewhere to sit down and grip something intensely while I think my violent thoughts to myself. My OCD is various movement and touch based compulsions, mainly based on the symmetry of my body. I have to do certain things with both limbs, hands, feet, etc, like If I stub my right toe, I have to stub my left toe. The main nuggets of advice I would give to you is to consider alternative methods of tic suppression if you haven't already. This includes avoiding caffeine, avoiding sugar, maybe meditating, going to tourette's therapy if you can, deep breaths, tourette's support groups, or finding an outlet for the aggression like a stress ball. I was carrying one around with me for a while and it was super useful. I would rather look a little weird with a stress ball than yell at strangers. That's what I got, hopefully some of that was useful. Sorry if those are already things you have considered, or advice you've already received. Best of luck though on all fronts
