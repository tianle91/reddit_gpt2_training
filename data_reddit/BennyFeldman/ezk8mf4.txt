Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Honestly, I’d say the tick adds to the whole performance really well. It’s unique, and you don’t let it stop your roll which is really quite cool - I had a friend with Tourette’s a while back, and even though he had a hard time speaking in sentences without ticking, he always made me laugh with a well-executed joke or two; I lost contact with him a while ago, and this kinda makes me wonder how he’s been doing. Best of luck in the future, man!
