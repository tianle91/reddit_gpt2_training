Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: That was great, I love how you brought your tic into the act. I also love the quick POV comedy, the kind that makes you say "where the he'll is this guy going?" And then it's a pun like the Quakers, dinosaurs and oatmeal one.

A: Thank you! Very interesting to me that people see my set as a POV, because I see it as me talking about giraffes and dirt and stuff. Neat how outside people can view it differently Also Quakers is not supposed to be a pun, I think the oatmeal brand is just less popular than I thought
