A: Do you ever intentionally swear/tick? It seems like you have this rhythm that sort of peps up the tempo and makes me more anxious for the punchline/next joke, like built-in comedic timing. I wonder how aware you are of this and if you'd be above "playing into" it by adding a pause or a voluntary string of swear words for extra withholding/comedic impact.

A: Nope, all of the cursing and tics are real. I will add pauses definitely, but never extra strings of words, I think those detract from the timing for the most part
