Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Hey! Thank you so much for sharing this! You're fucking hilarious, and I love that you're helping people to understand Tourette's better. I was diagnosed this year after a peak. It's definitely weird finding out you have Tourette's in adulthood. Having to relearn how to be in public. I feel you. You're Mario joke made me very excited. I've made fun of my own "Wah!" tics for sounding like Mario.
