Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Makes total sense that you open by telling the audience you have Tourette’s. Have you ever considered not telling them and mentioning it at the end?

A: I think I only tried that once, but they were confused for the first few jokes, or thought I was doing a bit. Sometimes I say it after the first joke, or I'll open with "I still have tourette's" for people that know me. I think it would be more confusing for me to do it like that, than it would be funny
