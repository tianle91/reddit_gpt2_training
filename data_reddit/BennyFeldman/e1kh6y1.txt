Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Dude, you're so damn funny! I have Tourette's too, motor mostly, but I still would have a hard time getting on stage like that. It acts up way more when people are looking at me, every single time. Your tics don't draw from the hilarity of your performance one bit, and the way you make jokes about it make me (and I'm sure the audience too) feel more comfortable and laugh much more often. My girlfriend and I were DYING to your jokes, keep it going! I look up to your confidence
