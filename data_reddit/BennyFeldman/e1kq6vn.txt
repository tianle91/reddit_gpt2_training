Q: What do you think?
A: How do people treat/deal with the unexpected syntoms of this disability in public?

Q: How do people treat/deal with the unexpected syntoms of this disability in public?
A: Most people are aware of what Tourette's is, so they will just make it a point to ignore or not look at me. Sometimes I will catch people staring, or repeated stolen glances. Kids will flat out stare, I once overheard a kid ask her mom what was wrong with me and the mother kindly explained Tourette's to her. It can also depend on the word I say, like "Shit and Fuck" will get very little public reaction, but once in a while I will say "Faggot," and that will really take the air out of any situation.

A: I've got a question for you. When you were younger and before you knew the more explicit swears, were your tics different? Like more PG-13?

A: I didn't start having swearing tics until I was 21, I mostly just did lighter humming noises growing up
