Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Pretty funny, I feel lucky to be able to keep mine to small neck motions and vocal grunts, but they mess with my anxiety sometimes. Especially when I move my neck and here a weird click I'm like oh shit I finally snapped it. It gets worse when I'm waking in the middle of the night and have less motor control to say hey necks shouldn't go that far.

A: Thank you! Tics represent. Neck tics are definitely the most painful, that's the muscle I pull the most often
