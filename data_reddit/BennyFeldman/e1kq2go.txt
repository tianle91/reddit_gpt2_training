Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Have you ever met Josh Blue, the comedian with cerebral palsy? I know your conditiions are different, but your set reminded me of the times I've watched him and how he stays hilarious despite the constraints or challenges of the physical movements and speech caused by the condition, and it often seems to augment the humor. I think I laughed the hardest at the way you played your tic into the message in a bottle joke.
