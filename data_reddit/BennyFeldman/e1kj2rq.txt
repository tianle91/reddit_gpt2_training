Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: " *shit, fuck ass motherfucker, fuck* the police" I lost it right there with your second (rather, your first) video. I'm impressed with how you can fluidly incorporate your tics into your set for bonus laughter. Are giraffes your favorite animal? If not, which one? What are your long-term plans for stand-up comedy?

A: Thank you! Giraffes are the funniest animal in my opinion, my favorite is mountain goats! They're so wise I would love to put out a special eventually, of entirely just one-liners lol. Writing for TV is definitely something I am interested in, I would love to work on a cartoon show for a kids network, those were always the funniest imo, like spongebob, or honestly even something like Avatar Airbender
