Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I haven’t seen you before but I would encourage you to keep writing material, keep filming shows and really hope to see you get a Netflix special.

A: Thank you!! I wonder if Netflix will still be the main platform by the time I have a special's worth of material lol

A: To be fair, with your ticks taking up 1/2 to 2/3 of your timing, you need to write far less material than any other comedian. So you got that going for you, which is nice.

A: Lmao, maybe I'll release a special in five years on Disney + that is entirely just tics for an hour
