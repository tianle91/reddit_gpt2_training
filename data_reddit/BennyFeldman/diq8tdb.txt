Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Dude that shit is funny as hell! I have tourettes too and it makes me happy to see you owning it like this! I don't necessarily have any vocal ticks but more grunts with facial ticks. Like sometimes it feels like my face and jaw are trying to rip themselves off of my body. Makes for interesting first impressions to say the least. Can you tell me what your reason for getting into comedy was and how it seems so natural for you to work your ticks and vocalizations into your set? Because it totally works. I've tried open mic comedy a handful of times and I was always worried my facial ticks would distract from my jokes. Anyway, keep it up man, you're hilarious!

A: Thank you! TS Represent. I hate the face and jaw ones hahaha, people think I am making fun of them. I actually got into comedy before I had Tourette's, and I got really lucky that one-liners is a style that is pretty conducive to allowing Tourette's during the set.
