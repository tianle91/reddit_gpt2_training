Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I legit was smiling and actually laughed out loud several times during this. Never happens with comedy. Usually a full hour special gets a few chuckles. Your own commentary and jabs at your tourettes was super clever and funny as well, especially for on the fly. Oddly enough, the clicking paces out your lines, your timing is great. You've got tourettes metronome.

A: Thank you!! I know how rarely I laugh out loud at stuff when I'm just online, so I really appreciate that
