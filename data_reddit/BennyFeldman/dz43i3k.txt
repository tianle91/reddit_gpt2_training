A: I have a question regarding Tourettes; is it sort of like Restless Limb Syndrome, where you can fight it, but it feels very awkward and your brain kinda makes you (in this case) move it? Or is it all automatic and you can tell it's coming, but have no control?

In the video, consider the shaking to be mostly compulsions and the sudden shouts to be bursts
