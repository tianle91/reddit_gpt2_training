Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Enjoyed the video. Were guys like Mitch Hedberg and Steven Wright influencial in your decision to focus on one-liner comedy, or is it a result of it being easier given your Tourettes? Or both? Or neither? Or a percentile mixture of the first and second part leaning more heavily on one but certainly a quantifiable portion of the other?

A: Thank you! - Got into comedy before I had severe Tourette's, so one-liners came first, so entirely not related to the Tourette's - Went into one-liners because they were always my favorite - I got into Mitch Hedberg & Steven Wright more because I already loved one-liners - Hedberg is my all time favorite comedian now
