Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?

A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol. This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.

A: [There was a study about cursing and pain](https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-why-swearing-physically-reduces-pain/) that basically showed cursing allowed for a higher pain tolerance. I've wondered if that would extrapolate to tics, where using curses would effectively allow for a stronger release of the "tic energy" (for lack of a better term). I know after I have a tic, I can internally feel a slight internal relaxing of my mind and body. If I hold for longer, the release sensation is a little stronger, etc., so maybe that's part of the relation? Great set btw, that's original stuff you should be proud of. Also, I'm glad you didn't make TS the focus of the jokes, I think you'll do way better keeping your style as it is. I've seen comics that focus everything on an oddity about them, and that gets old quick. What you did incorporating TS in a handful of lines and improv lines was a perfect mix!

A: Oh that's fascinating, I 100% agree with the idea that the curses are used for a higher tic energy. Thank you for sharing, and for the kind words!!
