Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: My question is about tics associating with societally foul language. Why does it seem like tourettes tics are so often paired with words we deem inappropriate, rather than any random word?

A: I'm not sure! Only like 10% of people with tourette's have the cursing type, but I don't know why that is even a type. I've used the stubbing your toe metaphor a few times. You know how when you stub your toe, you mostly feel like cursing? I think it's the same part of your brain that is randomly getting fired for some reason.
