Q: What do you think?
A: Yes! So glad you're back with more jokes. I come back to your old sets pretty often. Keep it up! Who else in your one-liner comedy style do you like? Im a fan of Steven Wright, Mitch Hedberg, and Demitri Martin already. Would love to get some more reccomendations. Ps. If you ever need original music for videos, skits, or whatever, Id love to work with ya on what you want to make.
