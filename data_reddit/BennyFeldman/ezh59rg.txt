Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I'm sure you've been asked before but does weed or CBD oil help?

A: I have tried a few CBD gummies, but they are fairly low dose, so I want to try the actual oil. Weed though tends to make me anxious or have panic attacks (bad for tourette's lol), so I want to get a medical license and try strains with lower THC

A: Yeah I would imagine there might be a strain curated to the condition itself. I just thought since it helps with epilepsy it might carry over to this too.
