Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Do you tic when you type? Like does the part of your brain that causes you to express words uncontrollably have the same effect when typing? Does drinking have any effect?
