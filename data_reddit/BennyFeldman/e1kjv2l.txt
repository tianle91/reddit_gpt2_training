Q: What do you think?
A: You're hilarious! Greetings from Germany! And since you're open for questions: how do you feel about the Southpark episode that covers tourette? I'm sure your mailbox is currently exploding but if you're actually reading this, keep up the good work! Surf's up! Edit: where do you buy your clothes? That sweater is pretty neat

A: Hello Germany! Thank you! I saw that Southpark episode years ago, I remember thinking it was very funny at the time, but I honestly have no idea if I would like it currently. I bet I would tbh. Do they surf in Germany much? Sweater is from H&M in 2011 lol
