Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Please don't quit. I did my first standup routine in Los Angeles a little while back and it didn't turn out well... So I quit. Which is ok because it was awful. My routine was largely based on me being a ritard because, I had a brutal traunatic brain injury. It wasn't funny. You're funny. I quit and that's a very good thing. Don't you do that, though. You're fucking brilliant. I love this so hard. Edit: I nearly got in a fight with a comedian who was in the audience... And rightly so. I was an asshole and not funny. You, sir, are fucking brilliant!!!

A: Thank you! That's great advice, I won't do that!
