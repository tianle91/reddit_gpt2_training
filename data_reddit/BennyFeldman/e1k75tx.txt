Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Really good stuff. I know people have already mentioned your style is reminiscent of Mitch Hedberg's, but I don't think most people realize how hard it is to make that style work. If I were to get up and try to do Mitch's set verbatim, guaranteed it wouldn't work. Je ne sais quoi would be the only thing I could equate it to. Speaks volume's about his level of talent and yours. The subtle nuances are everything. Sorry for rambling on and on, I'm a bit stoned this morning (too meta?). Anyway, keep up the good work!!

A: Thank you! I am overjoyed that people keep comparing my style to Mitch Hedberg, I love his stuff. That was very kind of you!
