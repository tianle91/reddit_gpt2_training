Title: Tourettes vs Eggs

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: The more videos I watch of people with Tourette's the more I start to understand what they're going through on a daily basis. That's pretty terrible and I hope there's a way for them to be able to manage this. It really does feel like a general twitch of both muscles and even vocabulary along with various related ticks. On one hand, this is interesting but just makes me sad. So I have to always watch [Benny Feldman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWemo8jKdqs) because he's hilarious!
