Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: This was very funny! I had some trouble holding the laughter back on the bus, so a couple of people gave me strange looks. Anyway, I loved that even with a huge amounts of swearwords, you kept your jokes pretty clean. Even the joke about bestiality would be something I could say without my mom being offended. She might be confused if I slapped my neck though. Keep it up, I want to see more!
