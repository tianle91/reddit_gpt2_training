Title: Do any of you guys surf?

Body: I saw a Benny Feldman video today where he used the phase "surf's up" for some reason. It reminded me of a time when I used to surf with a guy with Tourettes pretty regularly. I was always amazed by how he could be ticking quite badly, then take off on a wave and his ticks would completely disappear until he finished the wave. Then they'd come back, but they wouldn't be as intense as before he'd ridden the wave. Another thing I noticed was that, when we were surfing spots that had really long waves, his ticks would disappear for the entire duration of the wave, even if it was an exceptionally long ride.


Anyway, I'm really interested to hear if any of you surf and what your experiences are with it. 

Q: What do you think?
A: I have never surfed! And I am Benny lol
