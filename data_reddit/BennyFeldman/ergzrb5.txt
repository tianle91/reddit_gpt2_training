Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. What's a bigger disability, the Tourette's or the mustache?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I highly recommend you post this to /r/Standup or /r/StandUpComedy Your joke writing is really good. You don't even need tourettes jokes, you just have a mind for comedy. The "I saw a dog kill a mouse the other day." bit was perfect. I think you could do an entire set of one liners without even mentioning your tourettes, then end on an absolute killer of closer that brings it all together.
