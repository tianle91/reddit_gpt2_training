A: I have been officially diagnosed by neurologists. From what I understand, if you get it before 18 it is likely to go away, but if you get it from 18-21, it is likely to stay. Might need to fact check me here. Edit: I also likely had a very mild form of tourette's as a child (throat clearing, head twitch), but it was not diagnosed until it progressed at the age of 21.
