Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?

Q: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?
A: I have way less tics when I am calm, so falling asleep is fairly normal for me! If I'm stressed out, that's probably what is keeping me awake as opposed to the tics. As for being asleep, I have had my friends monitor me while I asleep on two separate occasions. The first time I was entirely still and quiet, and the other time I apparently shook and kicked a lot, but with no clear vocal tics. So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.
