Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: This was quality entertainment! It's weirdly heartwarming to see someone lean into who they are or what they have to live with and create something with it. I've got a friend up in Philly I will be sharing this with so he can come see you! You mentioned Zelda, how big of a gamer are you? Does tourrettes impact being able to do some of the fine motor controls or are you able focus the tics away from your hands when playing?

A: Thank you, that warms my heart as well! Love gaming, favorite game is Dark Souls. I'm able to focus the tics away from my hands while I play. I was actually playing a while ago and I was tourette's-ing like "FUCK SHIT FUCK," so my roommate walked in and asked what boss I was on, but I was just walking down a hallway. edit: Actually, I don't actively focus the tics away from my hands, I think it's more subconscious
