Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Do you get used to the ticks? I genuinely get upset thinking about what having tourettes would be like its hard for me to grasp

A: Yes and no! I am used to the idea of having Tourette's, but I am still not used to the random outbursts that take me by surprise, which can sometimes be loud or very unwanted. I am very used to the public awkwardness of it to a certain degree though, like I just punch myself in the face on the train regularly and I'm used to people taking notice, but honestly, people don't really care that much because they see weird shit all the time.
