Title: Tics and stims

Body: For those who may not know, stimming is self stimulating behavior. It’s most often used with Autism, but everybody has stims. Shaking your leg, tapping your fingers, twirling your hair, etc. when you’re bored or nervous. 

When I get nervous or stressed, my tics increase. But sometimes I *purposely* keep doing some of my motor tics, like bobbing my head, shaking my hands, and rubbing my fingers together, because it gets some of that nervous energy out. It’s kinda self-soothing.

Anybody else do this? I think sometimes the lines between tics, compulsions, and stims can get a bit blurry.

Q: What do you think?
A: Yeah definitely, I'll stim to get the energy out when I specifically don't want it to burst out. If I'm in public, I'll stim a lot of low key weird neck shit, shakes, or mumbling to keep from yelling. I like to think of it as going into vibrate mode lol.
