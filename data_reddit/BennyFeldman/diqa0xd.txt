Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I have never posted a comment on Reddit before, but I felt it necessary to make an account to say how great a guy Benny is. My one story of Benny that I'll never forget: At the time I had only met him twice. Once through a friend on the football team, and the other at a party, near the Spring Garden Bridge, that I barely remember (because alcohol). Maybe a week after the party, I'm walking around campus, and Benny is on the other side of the street waving his arms up and down shouting my name, with the friendliest smile. I wave back and say "how's it going Benny" or something along those lines. I don't know if I have ever seen someone so enthusiastic to see me, especially someone that (to my hazy recollection) I only spent about 10-20 minutes talking to. Anyway I thought it was awesome, and wanted to share that story. Thanks Reddit.
