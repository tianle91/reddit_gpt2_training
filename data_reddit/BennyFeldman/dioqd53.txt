Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Solid 5 man. Good job. This isn't a criticism, but do you think the particular manifestation of your Tourette's will hamper you from gigs like mainstream late night TV (at least in the prudish US)? That FOIL joke is hilarious. The Italian on helium had me worried until you crushed it with that "Spaghetti" punch.

A: Thank you! Totally thought you meant 5/10 for a second, then realized you meant minutes. Yes, I do think it will be an issue if I were to ever do Live TV
