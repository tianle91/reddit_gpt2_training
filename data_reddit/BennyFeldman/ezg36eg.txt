Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?

A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol. This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.
