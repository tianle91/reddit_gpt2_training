Title: Tourettes vs Eggs

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: The more videos I watch of people with Tourette's the more I start to understand what they're going through on a daily basis. That's pretty terrible and I hope there's a way for them to be able to manage this. It really does feel like a general twitch of both muscles and even vocabulary along with various related ticks. On one hand, this is interesting but just makes me sad. So I have to always watch [Benny Feldman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWemo8jKdqs) because he's hilarious!

A: You should post more content on your channel! You're hilarious and your style of comedy reminds me of Mitch Hedberg.

A: I appreciate that! And for sure, I would love to post more, it just takes me a while to make videos. Currently working on a new five minute set
