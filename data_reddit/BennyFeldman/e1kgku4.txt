Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Hey Benny! i really like your jokes, nice work. I've never had a chance to ask this to someone with tourettes, so apologies if it seems like a dumb questions. But since you seem to have tics every few seconds, is it just completely impossible for you to mentally stop them from happening? Do you feel them coming on? Is there anyway you can will yourself to not tic? How would you describe it to someone who has never experienced it-is it like sneezing or hiccuping every few seconds?

A: It's a lot more like blinking than it is like hiccups. I can absolutely stop them or hold them in, but then they build up and I feel like I really have to do it. Imagine if you tried to hold your eyes open for five minutes while doing a stand up set. You might get through part of it, but then be like "fuck it" and just blink a ton, unable to even open your eyes for a bit. I can feel them coming sometimes, if they are more of a compulsion, like a slower build up. Usually though, if it's a sudden tic, I have to be actively holding it already in order to catch it. Good question, thank you!
