Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: This set could have been 10% as good and woulda been 10x as good as I was expecting. This was not gimmicky at all. You very amazingly include your tourette's in your routine, but it works *perfectly* still ignoring your ticks. I mean really, that was great on its own, your Tourette's is almost irrelevant to your set from my point of view. Very well done. You should be incredibly proud. I say this as someone who has done standup and has never gotten laughs like that, nor was I ever 10% as clever as that consistently.
