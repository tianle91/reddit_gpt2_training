Title: pins and needles

Body: hello
i am 14
basically, i have recently found that if i don't move or speak, i get pins and needles all over my body, which sometimes causes me to just randomly make a noise or move to stop it
any ideas on why?

Q: What do you think?
A: Hey, seems like that's some sort of [paresthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia), which could have a few different causes. Look into that, and see if it lines up with what you're feeling. If it continues or gets worse, consider seeing a doctor because it may be unrelated to the Tourette's.
