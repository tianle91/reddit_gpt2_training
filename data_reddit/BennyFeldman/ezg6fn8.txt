Q: Do you have delay your ticks a little as you finish jokes? How does that feel?
A: Oh weird, I definitely don't delay them after a joke, but I do mentally stop holding them back. There must be some delay between me letting go and them manifesting. The physical sensation of a tic is sort of a muscle tensing, or mental ebb and flow of tension that builds up. Depends on the tic, because some of them are very quick, and others I can sort of feel coming because the tension is weaker and has to build.
