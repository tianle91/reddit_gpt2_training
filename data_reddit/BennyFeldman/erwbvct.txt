Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Awesome set. As has been said, amazing integration of your tourette's (and yes, I looked up at the way you spelled tourette's four times to make sure i spelled it right ((only two times that go at it!))). But has anyone ever told you that your name sounds like a Jewish talent agent in the 50's and after years of scouting in seedy dive bars you found a hip black group playing the rock and roll and they have a sound the kids will really be able to bop to?

A: Thank you!! By golly, I've never gotten that before, but it means a lot coming from you, Johnny Carson (ogen)
