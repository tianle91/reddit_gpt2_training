Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I haven’t seen you before but I would encourage you to keep writing material, keep filming shows and really hope to see you get a Netflix special.

A: Thank you!! I wonder if Netflix will still be the main platform by the time I have a special's worth of material lol

A: I'm definitely working on it! I need to focus on having better writing systems in place. As for the drugs, great point. I'm fairly straight-edge, don't even really drink much, but I have been considering getting a medical marijuana license to help with the Tourette's. So maybe just the one !
