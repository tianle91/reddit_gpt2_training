Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I don't really have any questions, but I just want to say that as a person with tourette's I really look up to how well handle your tics and how you don't seem to get uncomfortable with them!

A: Thank you!! That means a lot coming from someone else with Tourette's. May your tics be forever well-timed, and your surf always be up
