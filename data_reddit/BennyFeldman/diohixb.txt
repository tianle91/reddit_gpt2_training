Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: You're hilarious. Two questions come to mind. (1) How long have you been doing stand-up and (2) to what extent are they related? These are great original one-liners, so you'd be great without the Tourette's; and yet your comfort with it adds something very unique to your set.

A: Thank you! 1) 3 Years working on it, 1.5 years actually performing in the city 2) I actually only developed Tourette's 2 years ago, which is super uncommon, so I was doing stand-up before I even had Tourette's
