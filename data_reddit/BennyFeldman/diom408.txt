Q: What do you think?
A: Hey, I really liked your set! You're quite funny. The bit about corporations as people got a big laugh out of me. I had a few questions for you, if you don't mind. * Do ticks change over the course of your life? * What did you think of the South Park episode about Tourette's?

A: Thank you! - Yes! I developed serious Tourettes at the age of 21 and only had like a mild not-diagnosed version when I was younger. Didn't start cursing and such until 22. - I actually haven't seen it!
