A: Did you choose that as the smoothest tick? Like were there other ones that were more abraisive, but shit motherfucker comes out smooth and friendly so you can gear your tick towards that, or reward that tic?

A: That's an interesting question, the answer is essentially that I think I did so, but sort of like subconsciously? Like, when you stub your toe, you end up yelling whatever the most accessible curse words are at that moment. I have actually literally never had "cunt" as a tic and I think it has something to do with it not having the same smooth quickness as "shit." Something to do with like the general mouth shape having to change too much maybe? In terms of rewarding a tic, and having that happen more often, I basically use the reverse method. I try very hard to hold back worse words, like the lgbt+ slur. I'm worried if I did that one too often, I'd end up basically rewarding it, and doing it more frequently. Interesting psychology, a lot to consider. It would be quite a whole feat if I were to be able to do this against any of the cursing in general. (Like how hard it is not to curse every time you stub your toe, if you stubbed your toe regularly)
