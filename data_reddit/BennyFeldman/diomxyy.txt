Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I'd like to point out to people (Way too late) that TS does not always induce vocal tics (such as saying "shit motherfucker" compulsively) it's a symptom called coprolalia that often goes hand in hand with tourettes but isn't always the case. Please refer to: https://www.tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia/ or other medical resources if you'd like to educate yourself.

A: Yes! I will try to make sure I don't misrepresent TS overall.
