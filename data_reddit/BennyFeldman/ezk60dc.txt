Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I LOVE how your sets aren't ABOUT Tourettes, but you work it in naturally. I also think it's very sweet how you make it okay for the audience to find your ticks funny. And the comparisons to Hedberg are well deserved. You have a very similar perspective on the absurdity of everyday life. If anyone tries to purchase the rights to make a movie about you, please require them to name the movie " The Benny Feldman shit mothafucka hup story"

A: For sure, I absolutely try to stay away from doing my sets about Tourette's. That's all very kind of you, thank you!! Movie would be called "Fucking, Birds"
