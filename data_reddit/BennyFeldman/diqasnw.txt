Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Loved it! Had me rolling!ðŸ¤£ Legit question- Why do people with Tourette's tend to cuss with their tics often? I assume they weren't given those words straight from birth. So, is it something picked up or what?

A: Thank you! Not sure why cursing Tics are a thing actually. Most people (90% or more) with Tourette's actually don't have the cursing type. Also from what I understand, most people don't develop Tourette's until around 7 years old, so that might help explain the birth situation. I personally did not develop the severe cursing version until I was 21, which is uncommon.
