Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Kudos to that guy for doing this. Must be hard to live with.

A: Thanks! I am that guy! It's actually not terrible most of the time, it usually gets significantly worse in certain public situations, like riding the train or performing in front of a crowd.

A: I didn't read the title very carefully. Seriously, you handle it well and the jokes were funny. Are you an aspiring comedian? Do you do this often? I've always wondered, does the literal tick sound you make help you stop the compulsions?

A: Thank you, I appreciate that! I am an aspiring comedian, I perform often in Philadelphia, probably about once a week or every other. That's an interesting question that sort of stumped me for a moment, I would say the literal tick sound does help stop the compulsions, but that is because it is a compulsion itself. It's just a shorter, stronger burst of one, so it gets rid of the energy more efficiently than shaking or tapping.
