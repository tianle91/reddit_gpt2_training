Q: Do you have an hour?
A: Nope! If I did every joke I have ever written, I would have like 2 to 3 hours, but I have roughly 10 minutes that I'm very comfortable with. I can do about 15-20 if I take some liberties, do some newer bits, or riff.

A: Maybe integrate a cool story about a time turrets had a meaningful or funny impact on your life. People are obviously put at ease by you and could take something meaningful away as well. You could talk for a hour about things like that and keep me captivated. Good job!
