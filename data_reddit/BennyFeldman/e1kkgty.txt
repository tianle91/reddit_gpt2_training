Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Dude, I love the skyscraper joke. I'm curious about Tourette's. Why specifically "bad" words. Like, if your parents were completely accepting and encouraging of every word equally as you were being raised, would it only be the ticks?

A: Thank you! I'm not sure if anybody knows why it is specifically curse words, closest guess I have is that it is similar to when you stub your toe, you are more likely going to swear than say regular words, you know? Gets the energy out in a certain way. I didn't have the cursing form of tourette's until I was 21, so the only issue with it for my parents growing up was that I would make humming noises too much, and even that was not that often
