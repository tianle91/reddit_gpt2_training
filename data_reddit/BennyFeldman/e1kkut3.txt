Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Hippos.... HAHA!! I was listening to this while look at something else. Not realizing you were pulling the mic away from your mouth when you had a tick I thought it was some guy in the audience being an asshole and making fun of you. I don't know much about Tourettes but you deal with it very well. It looks like you're just along for the ride (for a lack of better terms) when it does its thing.

A: Thank you! That's a funny perspective on it, someone else said something like that as well before, I will have to re listen with my eyes shut
