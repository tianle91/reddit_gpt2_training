Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I always thought people with Tourette's would curse using a lot of different curse words, or does it depend on the person's vocabulary? Anyway, an annoying thing to have, hope he makes it big, his jokes are funny, without or without Torette's

A: Thank you! Everybody's Tourette's is different, and it's usually not even cursing, I just happen to have that particular form. I say Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, Piece of Shit, and many other variations on those mostly. My favorite is "Punk ass motherfucker."
