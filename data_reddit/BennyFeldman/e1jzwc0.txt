Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: At 30 I am just now accepting that I'll probably never be rid of my (minor motor) ticks and not being as self conscious about it. But damn, I am nowhere near a level comfortable enough to go on stage or really talk with more than 3 people looking at me. The ticks integrate really well with the set, it add a whole other level that is just part of it, great job!
