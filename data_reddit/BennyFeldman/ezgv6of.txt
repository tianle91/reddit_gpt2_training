Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Oh wow, did someone in Nirvana have Tourette's?? I do like that song, I've been listening to a lot of Q and Not U and that reminded me of them for some reason

A: I don't know if he knew anyone with Tourettes irl. He was interested in medical disorders and a lot of his songs had manic punk rock vocals. Keep doing that act man! it's a talent to make people laugh with original one liners.
