Q: What do you think?
A: Great set, love the nickname! RIP Mitch. Reading your other comments, the tics flare up when you're anxious or in social settings... Is there any medication you can take to calm them down? How does weed (bud or oil) affect the tics?

A: Thank you!! I was on medicine for a while, specifically Guanfacine, but it hurt my heart lol, so I stopped taking it. I've been strongly considering getting a medical marijuana license because I think it would definitely help me out. I want to start with CBD oil though, and I've only had limited experience with that in the form of CBD gummies, but those are fairly low dose. I think the oil will help though! Shout out placebo effect
