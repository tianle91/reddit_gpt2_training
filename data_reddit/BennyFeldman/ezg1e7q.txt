Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Great set, very funny! Serious question, does your neck hurt? My neck hurts just from normal everyday overstraining. If it does hurt, how are you alleviating it. Keep up the good work, hope to see more on here soon.

A: Thank you!! Great question, and my neck generally doesn't get sore, but I do sometimes pull the muscle and that will hurt a bunch for a few minutes. When that happens on stage, I just have to take a long pause before I continue and push through it, but it usually subsides quickly. My face gets the most sore, but I don't do much about that. My wrist gets more like hurt the most often. I've been wearing a brace for my wrist sometimes recently, to sort of help with a more recent tic I've been having where I aggressively shake my hand (usually the left).
