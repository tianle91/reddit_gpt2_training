A: Benny, what would you say if you never learned the curse words? Like we aren't born knowing to say "fuck" or "motherfucker." If your ticks weren't to say stuff like that, what would relieve the pressure? I am not trolling. I am curious about this.

A: Good question, I'm not sure! I heard somewhere that curse words are a different part of your brain than regular language, so maybe something to do with that? Sometimes a good solid guttural shout or grunt will relieve the pressure for me, anything sort of aggressive. Most people with Tourette's (90% or so) don't curse actually, they just make a variety of noises and have body tics. Sometimes they say non-curse words as well, like there's a lady who is famous for saying "biscuits." Hope that explains anything lol
