Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I've got Tourette's too, and while not a comedian, a lot of my jokes when around friends do reside in the self-deprication that only one afflicted with Tourette's could give. My personal favorite is that I'm the worst hide and go seek player ever.

A: I like that joke! Honestly, at this point, I've made so many bad Tourette's jokes that my friends are sick of it, so they always just reply, "Oh, do you have Tourette's?"
