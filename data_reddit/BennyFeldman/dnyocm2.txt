Title: I was interviewed on Tosh.0 about my stand-up and Tourette's - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Have you not always had Tourette's and how do you "get" it? I was under the minimally educated impression it was a lifetime disorder. Good stuff, I liked your set.

A: Hey, good question, I had no idea either. So, I had a milder form of undiagnosed Tourette's growing up, but it became far more severe when I was 21. A lot of people with Tourette's develop or "get" it when they are between the ages of 7-14. It often significantly fades or lessens for good by the time they are no longer teens, but if it comes back or worsens then it is likely to stay. Hope that helped clear it up. Also, thanks!
