A: Do you ever intentionally swear/tick? It seems like you have this rhythm that sort of peps up the tempo and makes me more anxious for the punchline/next joke, like built-in comedic timing. I wonder how aware you are of this and if you'd be above "playing into" it by adding a pause or a voluntary string of swear words for extra withholding/comedic impact.
