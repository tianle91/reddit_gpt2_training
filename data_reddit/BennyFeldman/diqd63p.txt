Q: You're a fake.
A: why u think so

Q: why u think so
A: Think? Lot'f of things. From the fact that it took you 24 hours to respond to the fact that every "tick" you supposedly have seems to happen conveniently right when you need them to. You are a liar.

A: I see your points. So, it took me 24 hours to respond because I have real world stuff to do. You'll notice a response gap for all of my posts starting around 5:30 yesterday when I went out with friends. The delay was not just for this post. As for the tics that happen when I need them, that's for two reasons: First is that I only do the tic punchlines (fuck the police) when a particular tic happens, such as "fuck." So they seem well timed, but they are actually reactionary. Second is because I try to let the Tourette's happen between jokes so that I can release the tension. If I don't, it may happen during the joke, which kills the delivery. I can hold it for brief periods of time, but it's like a tension that builds up. Best way to explain it, it's sort of like blinking. Most of the time you just blink whenever. But you can choose to hold your eyes open if you want to, but if you do so for an extended period of time, you feel like you really have to blink. So, I am letting myself 'blink' between jokes so I can 'hold my eyes open' during the jokes. I hope that helped explain it?
