Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Weird question, but how does a tic feel? With the twitch I wonder if you're in pain. And do you remember what you said immediately afterwards?

A: Feels sort of like a sudden muscle tensing, or a build up and release of mental tension! That can all happen very fast too, so I don't always feel the build coming. I sometimes look like I'm in pain, but it's only painful if I jerk my neck or do the same movement for a long time. I always remember what I said as well!
