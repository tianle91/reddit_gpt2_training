Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: How often do your verbal ticks change? Or did it manifest after you learned shit motherfucker?

A: For most of my life my vocal tics were mostly just humming and throat clearing, and then when I was 21 it switched to cursing! I would say it's been fairly consistently the same few curses, with the occasional increase in an unusual one, like the F slur for the lgbt+ community. That one seems to be the most variable in the last few months for me, either being fairly often or not at all.
