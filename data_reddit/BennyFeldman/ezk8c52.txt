Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Sometimes! If I am looking for it, I can always catch it, but if I am not paying attention I don't always notice the build up. And some of them are just very fast and sudden anyway. Sneeze is a good comparison for the ones I do see coming though! Just trying to get Samuel L Jackson to add me to the avengers. I will be "the tic"
