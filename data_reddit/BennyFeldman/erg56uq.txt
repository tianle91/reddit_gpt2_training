A: Hell yeah, thank you!

Q: Hell yeah, thank you!
A: Also love the fact that you’re in here replying to every comment. Good on ya. Watched a different set, the joke about Italians on helium was best. I love physical comedy and I’m gonna tell that to my niece who thinks I’m the worst comedian.

A: Hell yeah, I love physical comedy. I seriously strongly considered closing this set with just me doing some comedy dancing for like a solid minute. I couldn't quite figure out how to frame it properly, but it's still a bit I'm working on. Hope she likes the joke and her respect for you & your comedy increases ten-fold!
