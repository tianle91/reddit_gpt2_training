Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. What's a bigger disability, the Tourette's or the mustache?

Q: What do you think?
A: Very solid one liners. The “cut out the middle man” was my fav. Your timing is so solid, How is your timing not affected by your tics?

A: Thank you! I essentially try to get into a rhythm back and forth, where I hold the tension of the tics in order to say a joke, and then I release the tension when I'm not talking. That way, I'm able to not be interrupted too often (still happens tho), and I'm still able to get the tension out.
