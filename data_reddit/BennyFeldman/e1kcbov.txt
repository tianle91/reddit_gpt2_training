Q: What do you think?
A: Is it put on at all? Are all of the ticks genuine or are some added for comedic effect?

A: I never add them for comedy, I feel like that would have a certain dishonesty to it. I do let them happen though, so that they don't build up. If I feel a particular type coming on that I have a good riff for, I will let it happen. Like with the buffering joke, I might let the shakes happen, but I don't fake them if that makes sense.
