Q: What do you think?
A: This is silly and great and I like it. Being a one line comedian is probably already the hardest type, simply because you have to write sooo many original jokes to fill your time. Keep up the good work, internet stranger!

A: Thank you! I'm glad you appreciate the amount of time it takes, every joke only gets me like another 15-20 seconds, it's ridiculous. I will try to keep it up!
