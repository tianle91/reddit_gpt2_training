Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Really great material. I love how you comment on your tics occasionally, it helps make the audience more comfortable for sure. Is it possible for you to control the types of words you use during a tic? I’m wondering if your use of swears has hindered any possible television work. You’d be so great on late night tv.

A: Thank you! I am able to not make noises and sort of go into vibrate mode if I am not talking, but if I am talking or performing it is almost impossible for me to stop the curses. I would love to do late night though, if they have a quick censor lol
