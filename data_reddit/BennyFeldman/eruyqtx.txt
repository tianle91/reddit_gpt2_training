Q: What do you think?
A: I love how you've taken your condition and created a style of comedy that works well with it. I can see how long form stories would be more difficult, but these one liners are perfect. The hairless peanut butter bit had me absolutely dying. I love comedy and i find it difficult to discover comedians with original and funny bits, and you had me rolling my dude. I can't wait to see where you go from here.

A: Thank you!! That's very kind, I appreciate that. I've been trying to figure out if there's a way I could do a long form story, but it would definitely have to be allowed to be choppy lmao
