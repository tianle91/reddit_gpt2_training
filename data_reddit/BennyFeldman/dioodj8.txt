Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Great skit. You're brilliantly funny. I have a technical question: what's the point of the lavalier microphone? It looks like you're trying to limit the amount of profanity going into the hand-held one but it's entirely defeated by the lavalier mic picking up everything.

A: Thank you! Great question, I'm not actively trying to limit the audio going into the hand-held, I'm actually just unable to focus on holding it properly as I Tourette's. It might look like I Tourette's to the side to avoid the mic, but it's mostly because my head jerks back.
