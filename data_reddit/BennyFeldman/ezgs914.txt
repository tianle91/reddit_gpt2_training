Q: What do you think?
A: A question I've always had about Tourette's is why do so many people with it use curse words? I mean I understand it's involuntary but has anyone ever figure out why it seems to be curse words so often? Great set btw.

A: Great question, I also would like to know! I don't think they have any idea what causes Tourette's, or why some people (around 10% or so) having the cursing type. It is a mystery, much like the deep blue sea. Shout out to the ocean. Thank you btw!!
