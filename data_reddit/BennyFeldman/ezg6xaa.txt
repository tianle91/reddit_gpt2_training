Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: I;m sorry to dwell on the swearing, as I can see that's what an awful lot of the questions pertain to (and it only affects 10%, as you said), but I wonder if you were raised in a very religious household with no swearing at all, what words would be the tick? Also, do you ever type swear words unintentionally?

A: I was personally raised in a fairly secular, but reform Jewish household, but I didn't really have the cursing tics until I was older (21 or so). Maybe if I had them when I was younger and was more Jewish, I would have said something like Shmuck lol. I never type swear words unintentionally, but that is a type of Tourette's that I have heard of! I personally do not have it though
