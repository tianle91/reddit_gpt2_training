Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: every time i see something like this, i can't help but think that they act that way, or exaggerate these ticks. from a definition of ["tourette syndrome"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome): > Coprolalia (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette's, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. or maybe all of these 10% are comedians?

A: I understand why you would doubt it, seems fairly ridiculous. It is not exaggerated, I just happen to be in that 10% category. I also let it happen when I am on stage, so I don't try to hold it back. The issue with holding it back would be that it would build up and then come out all at once. I do have significantly less Tourette's when I am relaxed and not on stage in front of people telling jokes, so the nerves play a large part in amping up the tics.
