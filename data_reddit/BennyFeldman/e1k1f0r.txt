Q: What do you think?
A: Great tight set... I especially loved how you rolled with the punches and incorporated the tics into your set. Do you have a website? I'd love to see you if you toured around. And no for no reason... I started singing Elton John... "B-B-B-Benny and tourettes" in my head.

A: Thank you! [Here is my website](https://bennyfeld.com), it's got some other goofy stuff as well. Looking to go on the road eventually! edit: Love the Benny and Tourette's! Weirdly enough, I've gotten that a few times
