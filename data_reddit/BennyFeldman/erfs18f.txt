Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. What's a bigger disability, the Tourette's or the mustache?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Are your tics that constant, or does being on-stage and being anxious/nervous have something to do with it? I don't know much about Tourettes, so this is an honest question.

A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.
