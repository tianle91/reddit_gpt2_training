Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Great Stuff! It's refreshing to see an open micer who can actually write a quality joke! You kind of have a head start having Tourette's Syndrome. In the sense that you cannot help but be authentic up there, much less own it, and have fun with it. Not that TS is who you are of course, but it's a great way to show your vulnerable side and build rapport with the audience. In this regard you have a leg up, but your material is clearly miles above most beginners, so you truly do have a lot going for you! You are open, honest, and comfortable on stage and you are naturally funny! It really does seem like you would go very far in comedy!

A: Thank you!! That's all very kind, I appreciate that. I definitely use the Tourette's as a foot in the door (and then my foot shakes lol). Then beyond that, I just try to only rely on jokes, and not the Tourette's, because just harking on the TS would be a very boring gimmick
