Q: What do you think?
A: Last year, I was diagnosed with a tic disorder that showed up as a co-morbid disorder to ADHD, so I know the struggle with the motor tic part all too well. Do you find that if you suppress the tics that it leads to some anxiety and then they flare up later? I often worry about what people will think of me if I tic in class or in public, so I tend to suppress it and then it gets worse later. It’s pretty inspiring to see you take it in stride like that.
