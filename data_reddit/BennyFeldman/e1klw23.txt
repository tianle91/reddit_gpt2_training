Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: Very good work! You’ve gotten a lot of praise from this thread, and it’s well deserved! Great jokes and really good attention to timing, incorporating your unplanned moments in on the fly. Sounds like you have experience with improv, and that’s gotta do wonders in helping make that work. You GOTTA keep posting stuff from your sets. I could see you doing really well with a lot of the standup ventures in LA, based on a lot of the podcasts from comedians I like to listen to around there. Keep up the good work, and good luck on future joke-crafting!

A: Thank you! That's very kind of you, I'll try to do LA at some point!
