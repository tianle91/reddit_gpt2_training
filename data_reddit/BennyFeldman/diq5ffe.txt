Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm gonna tell you a story that shook the Czech Republic, regarding Tourettes (hopefully it won't get buried). Trust me, it's worth a read. There's this show, Come Dine With Me, where five competitors each make the others dinner one day and they compete to be the best cook of them. On March 23rd, the most legendary of episodes was aired. It involved a host with Tourettes, permanent erection, granny fetish, chicken as a pet and coffin for a bed. It was insane, many people thought he was hired by the TV to increase views. He was indeed fake, but not hired by the TV, he was there for a recess group called [Onemanshow](https://www.stream.cz/porady/onemanshow) (Czech link), who specialise in such pranks as [fake video of Justin Bieber getting pantsed](http://www.tmz.com/2016/11/18/justin-bieber-pantsed-fans/), fake [Jim Carrey coming on the stage of prestigious Czech movie awards](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/24/fake-jim-carrey-unmasked-at-czech-film-awards), smuggling themselves into Russia in a škoda car that was exhibited at the Hockey Championship (and creating a [fake video of an American fan pissing into Datsyuk's shoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZABXjtqfdQI&user=fireprofcargo)) and many more. Back to Come Dine. This guy (Karel) has none of these things I described, he is in reality a totally normal amateur actor. That appartment with chicken and a coffin was not even his. It also was not a 2+1 as it seemed on the show, but a 4+1. Where did the two rooms go you ask? well, they became [the secret Onemanshow headquarters of course](http://imgur.com/63Fgmet)! Kazma (the leader of the show) and some other guys locked themselves in total darkness and silence in there for 17 hours. One sound and it's all fucked. In the kitchen and dining room (middle top and middle bottom respectively), there were two large mirrors. And if you know how two way mirrors work, you can probably figure out why they were there. So he cooked, but he can't cook at all. How do we make him cook without him making an absolute fool out of himself and probably jeopardizing the whole operation? Well, first off you create a hole in the wall behind the oven. Second of all, you make a special oven that doesn't work but has a door that opens in the back. Third, that door leads into your backstage. Fourth, you get three of the country's best chefs cooking similar foods to what he is, except they use the best ingredients in a restaurant located near the appartment (Karel can use like whatever to make it *look* vaguely similar). Fifth, use a pulley to deliver the good food from the chefs to the backstage and carefully (and quietly) switch them in the super oven. That's not all, one of his competitors accidentally locked himself inside the coffin bed. Well... accidentally... There actually were *two* fake competitors in the show. However, they didn't use this power to win it and get $2000. No. The best part? If Onemanshow didn't release their video showing off all this, *literally nobody would have known.* The reason they did all this is that one of their team members also has Tourettes. For the longest time they were looking for a way to help him, but didn't know how. A lot of Czechs didn't even know what the syndrome is and creating an awareness ad that runs for at least the entire week on primetime would costs hundrets of thousands. But with Come Dine, "tourettes" has become the \#1 search term on the czech internet. Their video describing this massive project broke records and gained 3.5 million views on a website made for a 10 million nation. It's literally bonkers.
