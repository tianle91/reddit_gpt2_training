Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: That was a great set. I used to work with a guy that had Tourettes. He had some of the same nervous ticks and said the same stuff like you. He didn't take his medicine because he said it made him like a zombie. He told me that humidity makes it worse. He was from New York but had moved here to Louisiana for the job. Is it true that humidity makes the nervous ticks worse? Joe said some crazy stuff and almost got us in trouble a few times for saying the N word. When i say "us" its because we were out in a bar setting or leaving work through the skywalk. I forgot to mention, that was one of the curse words he said a lot.

A: Thank you, I have no clue about the humidity, that's not something I have ever noticed personally, but everybody's Tourette's is different. I've said the N word a few times as well, definitely one I try to avoid!
