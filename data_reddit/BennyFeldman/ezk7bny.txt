Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: It's great to see a comedian who doesn't lean on that condition like a crutch. It's there but you just kinda own it, you shrug off the bad and appreciate the good along side the audience, and if it wasn't there at all you'd be just as funny. I hope we see more of you pop up around here.

A: Thank you!! I try not to use it as a crutch whatsoever, I wish I could just do the jokes without it. Oh well lmao, it's still sort of fun!
