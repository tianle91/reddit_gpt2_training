Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: Were you always saying shit motha fucka? Was it something else growing up or was it developed later on?

A: From ages like 7-21, I pretty much just had a milder head twitch and occasional humming / throat noises that weren't even diagnosed as Tourette's. But then when I was 21, I started to develop the curses and the stronger body tics. While I have had the cursing tics though, it's been fairly consistently Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass, and sometimes I say a few worse words. The most intense word I say consistently is the F slur for the queer community, and I've only said the n-word a handful of times. I have never said bitch, cunt, dick, penis, general dirty stuff, or most racial slurs. I say piece of shit and asshole pretty often too.

A: Why wouldn't that have been diagnosed as Tourette's? And is development like this normal?

A: It probably would have been, but it was never severe enough for us to go to a neurologist until I was older. This is not normal, most people get tourette's from 7-14 and then it gets milder or even goes away, but sometimes it can stay the same, or in my case, get worse lol.
