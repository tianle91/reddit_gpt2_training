A: My neck muscles can get super sore if I have the head shaking Tourette's a lot, but most days I am not in enough high excitement situations for it to be too much of an issue. Most of what I do is facial twitches, and that can really mess with my eyes and contacts, causing them to water up a bunch, but that's more annoying than anything.
