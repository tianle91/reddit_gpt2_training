Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: As a fellow Tourette's sufferer, a lot of your tics seem a bit exaggerated. Maybe it's to make it more amusing for people, but I find it somewhat distasteful. You're promoting the false narrative that Tourette's causes you to curse uncontrollably which is not the case 99% of the time.

A: You make a great point, and I do want to make sure that people know that most people with Tourette's do not have the cursing version like I do, and also that I have it significantly worse on stage compared to my everyday life. My personal version of Tourette's does actually cause me to curse uncontrollably. It gets way worse when I am nervous, stressed, excited, anxious, or in other elevated emotional states, such as performing stand-up before a live audience. I agree that there is a false narrative around Tourette's, where people think it is always uncontrollable cursing, and I will try to inform people against that narrative.
