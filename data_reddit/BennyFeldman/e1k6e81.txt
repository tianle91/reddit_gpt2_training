Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. When I tic, it's just the set buffering. - Benny Feldman

Q: What do you think?
A: This is awesome - My favorite part was the message in the bottle riff, funny how that part got more laughs than the punchline. Was that intentional? Either way keep it up. I noticed there were parts of your show where your ticks were less intense, does performing help with them? I know of a rapper named "Scroobius Pip" who has a serious stutter that disappears while he's rapping.

A: Thank you! The bottle riff was not intentional, that was just pure luck, but I do have some of the riffs semi planned. The thing is, certain tics have to happen before I can do the riffs. The Zelda noise one is actually one I have done before, and I only do that riff if I happen to have that specific noise tic while I'm on stage. Performing actually makes them worse! I am very nervous and full of adrenaline when I am performing, so the moments when it is less intense are when I start to feel more relaxed. Lol, I will look that rapper up, that's a funny name
