Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: These jokes are so good! Some of them didn't get a great crowd reaction but they had me cackling (the pb allergy one LOL). I swear whenever I see some unknown comedian, they're almost always hilarious. This one's no exception! I don't know how the biggest comedians these days have such huge followings but it feels like they don't actually have funny jokes (Rogan, Schaub, Brad Williams, Kriescher, Santino). Like yeah Santino and Kriescher are pretty funny on podcasts but even with them the stand up isn't there for me. Its almost like the LA "comedy elite" is just a circlejerk of status that doesn't actually care about whether or not you have good jokes. I'd much rather watch something like this that's actually funny.

A: Thank you!! For sure, I think a lot of the comedy these days is more driven by opinion and agreement with a crowd than it is about the jokes, and I try to have absolutely no opinions in my act lol
