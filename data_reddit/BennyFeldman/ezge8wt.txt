Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Great material and delivery! If you don’t mind sharing: Have you had to work on your fluency and on reducing anxiety while performing or has your delivery always been this smooth? I don’t know much about Tourette’s, but it seems to me as though you are fairly “in control” of your tics and your delivery is so calm and composed (which, in my opinion, works great with your material); I found it really impressive.

A: Thank you, I appreciate that!! I have definitely had to work on my anxiety. Not my fluency, I think that's been alright, but I had to work on not being as aggressive and holding the tics back by force. I now sort of hold the reigns more gently, if that makes sense, so I'm overall more relaxed. Holding it more aggressively makes me seem way more stand-off ish, with the same fluency, but sort of loosely controlling the flow has a smoother rhythm to it, and I'm calmer.
