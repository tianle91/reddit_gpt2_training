Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Yo! If you have questions about the Tourette's or anything, feel free to ask below. Quick note, I have posted this video before, but I posted it on like a Monday evening (while at work lol). I wanted to see if it would do better on a weekend. \~ Surf's up \~ Edit: Heck yeah!! I appreciate all the kind words. If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog). Surf culture will never die

A: I’ve wanted to be a comedian my whole life and just started seriously writing jokes @ age 30 after like 8 years of working in Banking. How did you first get up on stage/any resources or tips for writing? Also your fucking fantastic man, Tourettes aside, your pace, delivery, and relentlessness is very Mitch hedberg. Imo there aren’t a ton of comedians I enjoy that use this format. The goat ending was superb!

A: Hell yeah dude, pursue the shit out of it! For your first time on stage, you might want to go with a friend or something, that's what I did. After that, I just sort of buckled down mentally and tried not to worry about it not going well. As for writing tips, I would honestly say check out Gary Gulman's twitter, he's putting out a tip everyday for a year and they are a fantastic resource. Thank you a ton!!
