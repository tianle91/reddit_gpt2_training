Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. What's a bigger disability, the Tourette's or the mustache?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: One of my nephews has Tourette's. He's 13 and a lot of his tics are very similar to yours, except he gulps air and pushes it through his throat like a frog instead of cussing. The more excited or nervous he gets, the more his tics pronounce themselves. He's never let it get in the way though, and I'm amazed. All his life, if anyone ever said something, he'd explain his condition as simply as if were his t-shirt. It's awesome. He's awesome. I'm not sure how many jokes he'll get, but I wanna show him this video anyway.

A: Word, I have previously had some lung tics as well. Good to hear he's so comfortable with his Tourettes, hope he likes the jokes!
