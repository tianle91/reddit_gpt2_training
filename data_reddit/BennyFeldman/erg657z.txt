Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. What's a bigger disability, the Tourette's or the mustache?

Q: What do you think?
A: this was really funny!! and i feel like you worked the 'tics' in with the material very well... as in, on the larger outbursts you sometimes told a little side joke or something to kind of bring us back in. very nice cadence and delivery of the jokes. but most importantly, your jokes were all high-calibre for the entire set! hope to see more some day
