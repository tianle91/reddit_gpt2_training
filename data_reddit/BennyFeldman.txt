Title: I'm a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I get called "Twitch Hedberg" pretty often - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Post more content on your channel. There's a lot of less funny individuals doing pretty alright by posting "try hard"(super animated, borderline obnoxious) material. Your laid back, and genuine, approach sells the whole thing. At least for me, anyways. How often do you perform?

A: That's both very kind and solid advice, thank you!! I perform anywhere from one to three times a week, depending on shows and mics. I would love to post more videos, but it takes me a while to have a new five minutes that I'm excited to put out. I'm working on having a better turn around time though, and focusing on having better systems in place to do so.

A: Brainstorm with fellow comics you see at the venues you frequent. Maybe a once a week skit where you guys/gals sit down for breakfast/beers/lounging around and share embarassing stories, favorite heckler moments or sad stories with morbid endings. Give it reletive names. "Fucking Shit Breakfast" "Clicking and Ticking" or... Whatever. It's your rodeo. I'm excited to see more from you.

A: When you have a tic or multiple in a row does it ever feel like you have to fight it? If so does it help? I sort of imagine it like having a bad dream and mentally telling yourself to snap out of it, but I know tics are just involuntary movements or noises. I had a sound I made a lot as a child that was a tic which I remember being uncomfortable, but not until I focused on it or was made aware that I was doing it. You seem like you're very aware during your performance, but when you're not in front of an audience does it just become normal at that point and more of a slight nuance or not noticable at all? Also your sun joke was also my favorite! Great performance!

A: I feel like I have to fight it when the sensation is strong and I am in a place or situation where I don't want to be having tics loudly or blatantly. The tics are like sudden bursts of the sensation that causes me to involuntarily move or make noise, and compulsions are like slower waves of the sensation. I can hold either of them, but they build up and eventually come crashing out. Good catch, it is significantly less intense when I am not on stage. I am a lot more excited and nervous when performing than when I am just hanging out otherwise. When I'm alone in my room, it's mostly just smaller compulsions, like a lot of facial twitches, with the occasional larger outburst. Thank you! That joke is also my roommate's favorite joke lol

A: I'm definitely working on it! I need to focus on having better writing systems in place. As for the drugs, great point. I'm fairly straight-edge, don't even really drink much, but I have been considering getting a medical marijuana license to help with the Tourette's. So maybe just the one !

The problem is that she is going to get really mad at me if you shave the mustache and are less funny, so I guess it will be my job to keep surf culture alive for at least another year.

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?

A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol. This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.

If you like this video and are looking for more of my shit, I have two more stand-up videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PYPjlmwgUvcxy3x2kZX6g), and my twitter is [@feldfrog](https://twitter.com/Feldfrog).

A: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?

Q: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?
A: I have way less tics when I am calm, so falling asleep is fairly normal for me! If I'm stressed out, that's probably what is keeping me awake as opposed to the tics. As for being asleep, I have had my friends monitor me while I asleep on two separate occasions. The first time I was entirely still and quiet, and the other time I apparently shook and kicked a lot, but with no clear vocal tics. So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.

A: Ah, but do you have tics in your dreams?

Q: Ah, but do you have tics in your dreams?
A: It's weird, for some reason I'm certain I do, but I don't have any distinct memory of it happening.

Q: It's weird, for some reason I'm certain I do, but I don't have any distinct memory of it happening.
A: Yeah, hmm, that brings up a related question. When you formulate a thought and communicate it but there is noise due to the tics, is your recollection of it maybe slightly distorted or blurry because of the tics that happened or perhaps that your mind masks over them? We have this base proprioception of how our bodies feel, move, interact, etc. I imagine that there is something similar in how we perceive our own thoughts and communication. I find it all fascinating. Regardless, great work man.

A: I don't think there's necessarily a noise/blur/distortion from the tics as much as there is like a sudden change in focus to the tic, if it is a particularly strong one, and that can disrail my train of thought entirely sometimes. Some of my tics are also purely mental, like I have ones where I repeat the same word over and over again in my head, until I realize it's a tic lol Thank you!!

A: \- I joined the improv team in college because a friend of mine told me to, lol. I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

A: Another note about marijauna making you anxious or paranoid, sometimes if a plant isn't correctly cured after being harvested it can make such effects worse. Though, going a pure CBD route is a good idea, I doubt you want to always be high to help your ticks.

A: Thank you!! I'm glad it wasn't distracting, I'm able to basically hold most of the tension of the tics while telling a joke, and then release it between, so I get into a sort of back & forth rhythm with it. There's a few specific like tic types that I have very often, so I end up doing a lot of the same or similar riffs

Q: Thanks lad! Is lad a term of endearment in general, like dude, or more specifically just a young guy?
A: Probably just a English thing, like fella or geeza. Along the lines of "what a guy" or "well done mate". "He's a good lad" means he's got a good heart in him. "He's such a lad" would mean more like lad culture (always drinking/chasing all the fit birds/on holiday in Ibiza/loves football etc). In your case, you did well and your set was funny especially when you incorporate your situation. Good on you, son (same principle as "lad")! :D

Title: I am a one-liner comedian with Tourette's. I am my own heckler. - Benny Feldman

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: After the first joke or two I was groaning, thinking maybe this was going to not be good, that his Tourette's was going to just be a novelty (not sure that's the right word, but can't think of a better one) that he used to get over, and his material was not going to be good. But, after one or two more jokes it became clear that no, he's actually got some good material there too. Definitely a high volume of jokes, and usually that means some aren't going to land, and I think that was true, but plenty did land and a couple landed really solid, so I dig, good job! But hey, question for those that know more about Tourette's than me: I know the whole "cursing Tourette's" is just one kind (and I believe not all that common)... I dated a girl once with Tourette's and she just did some relatively minor ticking for example... but why is cursing specifically a thing? Why those particular words with this guy? "Fucking shit-ass fuck" and such? It seems like if you were going to have Tourette's where you randomly exclaim words that it wouldn't be so specific and would be more random with other non-curse words (and maybe that's another form that I'm less familiar with?)... just curious about this.

A: Thank you! No idea why cursing is a thing, not sure if it's well understood neurologically yet. It totally might be though, I'll look into more sources. Going out on a wild limb, I think it might have to do with the cursing being a spoken reaction to the unexpected physical sensation? Tiny lil invisible gremlins all over my body pulling my limbs? Not sure!

A: For sure! I think I try to work with what people know already. That's the trouble with doing situation stuff, or "you had to be there" stuff on stage, people just don't know what you are talking about, or it takes too long to build the world. I focus on writing about topics that I think the average person would immediately recognize. Edit: beyond that for writing, I would say check out Gary Gulman's tip series on twitter!

A: Thank you! The bottle riff was not intentional, that was just pure luck, but I do have some of the riffs semi planned. The thing is, certain tics have to happen before I can do the riffs. The Zelda noise one is actually one I have done before, and I only do that riff if I happen to have that specific noise tic while I'm on stage. Performing actually makes them worse! I am very nervous and full of adrenaline when I am performing, so the moments when it is less intense are when I start to feel more relaxed. Lol, I will look that rapper up, that's a funny name

Title: Need Help

Body: Hey, my name's CJ and I've had tourettes since I was 12. And OCD prevalent since I was born. I'm 17 now. However, at first I mistook my tics for compulsions because of my OCD. Once I developed coprolalia during my GCSE exams when I was 16, I then knew it wasn't compulsions. I've dealt with my OCD now, I take 200mg of sertraline and it works like my eighth wonder. I feel normal again. I feel human again. However, the tourettes is still here (the sertraline has made it slightly better 20% I guess you could say). I can't but help want to say the most graphic and gruesomely vivid things to people, especially the people I love and want to get to know. I tell my own mother I want to f**k her up the a**e, I tell random lasses and lads I want to murder them. I couldn't come into my film studies class today because I had an unbearably relentless and cold tic to say to this girl "I'm going to r**e you and then kill you" Yes I know, that's not a tic that people would laugh at. People won't think I'm the class clown anymore when that s**t comes spraying out like a flamethrower.

If anyone here suffers with coprolalia is this normal? Is this supposed to be this extreme and relentlessly violent. I've never seen any tourettes this graphic on TV or youtube or any form of media what so ever. Is there something extra, extra wrong with me? I told the girl I really like in my Drama that's shes a c**t. I was seconds away from saying I want to f**k her. It broke my heart into pieces because she is so beautiful and things just keeping coming to screw things up. I need help really badly. I love people and I've been lonely for my whole life. I've dealt with my OCD since the second I've came into this world and I thought that would be the end of it, I thought that I wouldn't be scared anymore but my brain has came for round two and I need your guys' help to bring this thing down. Please, I'm fine If I can't get rid of my tourettes, but I need to know my options. What techniques can I use? What medications are widely accepted? What are your guys' experiences with coprolalia or medication in general? Please help me out. I'm so drainingly lonely. Now my OCD has gone, I've never ever wanted to connect to people more than I do now. I wanted to kill myself and kill others before I got help, I was like a school shooter. I didn't know the difference between reality and fantasy and psychosis completely consumed me. I don't want to be dragged back to that dark place, I won't let it, not again. I will never hurt anyone anymore, I've done that enough. I know what it means to be alive now. I won't be suicidal again, I'm too in love with the world and life to give up on it, so please, just help me. I like this girl a lot and I want to show her.

Q: What do you think?
A: I have coprolalia as well, but my tics are mostly just strings of curse words. I'm not sure how much my experience will be relevant or helpful, since you seem to have more severe social based tics, but maybe something strikes. Most people know what Tourette's is, so usually if I tell them outright and apologize kindly, they are very understanding. However, sometimes if I say something like "faggot" even the people who know still take a moment to process it. I often then have to remind them, usually jokingly, like "hey, look, I don't actually mean the things I say, I have Tourette's." It's always a tough situation with new people or if the tic is really bad, but being open and honest about it seems to work well. I realize your tics may be harder to explain away simply, but consider (if you don't already) telling everyone you meet immediately that you have Tourette's and that it's a possibility. I do that currently and find it's very helpful. In terms of medicine, I was on Guanfacine for a while, which seemed to help. It was basically keeping my heart rate from going past a certain elevation, but that would hurt sometimes. I went off it and found that if I try to keep my heart rate down in other ways, like avoiding coffee and sugar spikes, the tics were more passive. I also have OCD and bouts of extreme aggression, not usually put into words though. Not sure if the aggression is OCD or Tourette's or how that works to be honest, but when it happens I usually like to find somewhere to sit down and grip something intensely while I think my violent thoughts to myself. My OCD is various movement and touch based compulsions, mainly based on the symmetry of my body. I have to do certain things with both limbs, hands, feet, etc, like If I stub my right toe, I have to stub my left toe. The main nuggets of advice I would give to you is to consider alternative methods of tic suppression if you haven't already. This includes avoiding caffeine, avoiding sugar, maybe meditating, going to tourette's therapy if you can, deep breaths, tourette's support groups, or finding an outlet for the aggression like a stress ball. I was carrying one around with me for a while and it was super useful. I would rather look a little weird with a stress ball than yell at strangers. That's what I got, hopefully some of that was useful. Sorry if those are already things you have considered, or advice you've already received. Best of luck though on all fronts

But since you seem to have tics every few seconds, is it just completely impossible for you to mentally stop them from happening? Do you feel them coming on? Is there anyway you can will yourself to not tic? How would you describe it to someone who has never experienced it-is it like sneezing or hiccuping every few seconds?

Is there anyway you can will yourself to not tic? How would you describe it to someone who has never experienced it-is it like sneezing or hiccuping every few seconds?
A: It's a lot more like blinking than it is like hiccups. I can absolutely stop them or hold them in, but then they build up and I feel like I really have to do it. Imagine if you tried to hold your eyes open for five minutes while doing a stand up set. You might get through part of it, but then be like "fuck it" and just blink a ton, unable to even open your eyes for a bit. I can feel them coming sometimes, if they are more of a compulsion, like a slower build up. Usually though, if it's a sudden tic, I have to be actively holding it already in order to catch it. Good question, thank you!

Q: Is it put on at all? Are all of the ticks genuine or are some added for comedic effect?
A: I never add them for comedy, I feel like that would have a certain dishonesty to it. I do let them happen though, so that they don't build up. If I feel a particular type coming on that I have a good riff for, I will let it happen. Like with the buffering joke, I might let the shakes happen, but I don't fake them if that makes sense.

Q: What do you think?
A: Can you elaborate on the specific choice of words in your ticks? Are they words that you involuntarily pronounce? I’ve assumed that because it’s an involuntary tick that makes some words just kinda flow, but is there anything special about “shit motherfucker” over say “cumbucket trashdick” ? Does “shit motherfucker” have a personal, or specific, appeal? Also do you ever get scared to pick your nose?

Does “shit motherfucker” have a personal, or specific, appeal? Also do you ever get scared to pick your nose?
A: Great question, and for sure, there are definitely particular words that sort of scratch the itch in a very particular way, if that makes sense. A good way to relate to it is when you stub your toe, you don't go "Hello yes good day," you go "Fucking shit fuck." I think it's a similar part of the brain being activated. Some people though are able to redirect that and say other words, like when you stub your toe and try not to curse. That mental sensation (not including the pain of the toe) is sort of what it feels like when I try to hold it in, or redirect it. I'm not sure why those are my words in particular, but for some reason Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass are my main vocal tics besides the clicking noise. (maybe that's a curse in a different language? lol) As for picking my nose, I do not get scared and if anything, am too brazen! Lol, I haven't had any issues besides the usual tics there, but I can usually feel them coming ahead of time. The biggest face issue is when I am wearing glasses, I will tend to accidentally shake them off my head.

Q: Is your tourettes always that active ?
A: Nope, it gets a lot worse when I am excited/anxious/nervous, like when I'm on stage, or when I'm embarrassed. The worst it usually gets is if I have too much coffee, but most of the time it's actually fairly calm

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?

A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol. This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.

Really awesome, although I can imagine life isn't easy and a lot of people don't get it (I probably don't either). It's really cool that despite stress inducing you still perform!

A: Thank you!! Life is relatively normal for me socially because people that know me don't mind the tourette's. Strangers are the ones who notice more, but they don't really seem to care, and they don't matter anyway. And I'm usually fairly calm at work, so it's not much of an interruption.

A: These jokes are so good! Some of them didn't get a great crowd reaction but they had me cackling (the pb allergy one LOL). I swear whenever I see some unknown comedian, they're almost always hilarious. This one's no exception! I don't know how the biggest comedians these days have such huge followings but it feels like they don't actually have funny jokes (Rogan, Schaub, Brad Williams, Kriescher, Santino). Like yeah Santino and Kriescher are pretty funny on podcasts but even with them the stand up isn't there for me. Its almost like the LA "comedy elite" is just a circlejerk of status that doesn't actually care about whether or not you have good jokes. I'd much rather watch something like this that's actually funny.

Q: How do people treat/deal with the unexpected syntoms of this disability in public?
A: Most people are aware of what Tourette's is, so they will just make it a point to ignore or not look at me. Sometimes I will catch people staring, or repeated stolen glances. Kids will flat out stare, I once overheard a kid ask her mom what was wrong with me and the mother kindly explained Tourette's to her. It can also depend on the word I say, like "Shit and Fuck" will get very little public reaction, but once in a while I will say "Faggot," and that will really take the air out of any situation.

A: Thank you! Very interesting to me that people see my set as a POV, because I see it as me talking about giraffes and dirt and stuff. Neat how outside people can view it differently Also Quakers is not supposed to be a pun, I think the oatmeal brand is just less popular than I thought

A: That's both very kind and solid advice, thank you!! I perform anywhere from one to three times a week, depending on shows and mics. I would love to post more videos, but it takes me a while to have a new five minutes that I'm excited to put out. I'm working on having a better turn around time though, and focusing on having better systems in place to do so.

A: Brainstorm with fellow comics you see at the venues you frequent. Maybe a once a week skit where you guys/gals sit down for breakfast/beers/lounging around and share embarassing stories, favorite heckler moments or sad stories with morbid endings. Give it reletive names. "Fucking Shit Breakfast" "Clicking and Ticking" or... Whatever. It's your rodeo. I'm excited to see more from you.

A: Thank you! I'm not sure if anybody knows why it is specifically curse words, closest guess I have is that it is similar to when you stub your toe, you are more likely going to swear than say regular words, you know? Gets the energy out in a certain way. I didn't have the cursing form of tourette's until I was 21, so the only issue with it for my parents growing up was that I would make humming noises too much, and even that was not that often

A: For sure! I think I try to work with what people know already. That's the trouble with doing situation stuff, or "you had to be there" stuff on stage, people just don't know what you are talking about, or it takes too long to build the world. I focus on writing about topics that I think the average person would immediately recognize. Edit: beyond that for writing, I would say check out Gary Gulman's tip series on twitter!

A: That makes sense, I guess I already knew that most good comedians keep it relatable, I just never really thought about it. One other question, if you don't mind. How much material would you recommend preparing for an open mic? I'd be real embarrased if I only had 5 minutes and they expected 15, or if I went too long, you know?

A: Oh dude, you only need like 3 minutes for an open mic. Most will let you do 5, but you can go short for sure, and in fact, they WANT new people to do short. Most open mics do not do 15 lol. Honestly, I recommend that you go scout one out first just to watch and get the vibe, and then return a week later to sign up.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: Yeah I guess Tourette's must be terribly frustrating. You have ticks when you are anxious, and ticking makes you anxious, what a viscous cycle, compounded by having had a childhood with kids who no doubt don't understand and probably being naturally unsocial because of it to begin adulthood with. You mentioned elsewhere trying medical marijuana, I'd say go for it. Had a friend with Tourette's like 15 years ago in college and weed helped him (though wasn't a cure).

A: Well, full disclosure though, my tics were not as severe when I was younger, so I had a fairly normal childhood from that angle. I had milder tics starting when I was like 7 or so, but they were just like simple head twitches and humming, and I wasn't even diagnosed with Tourette's then. Around when I was 21 is when I started to develop the cursing tics and stronger body movements. As for the medical marijuana, I think that's definitely a next step! I'm thinking of getting more into CBD oil to start, just because the medical license off the bat is like 200 dollars. I've tried a few of the CBD gummies and stuff, but I don't think their dose was high enough to really make a difference. Glad the weed helped your friend though!!

I thought maybe she was hiding something from me, you know, like she was spending all this time on the computer. I wanted to know what she was up to, you know, and one day when she left the computer open, I just took a quick glance. She had open a bunch of tabs of Furry art twitter accounts, and was in like Furry fetish subreddits. Certainly not in my wheel house, you know, but I mean she was my wife, so I did my own research. Turned out, there was a Furry convention coming to town in like a week or so. So, I got this big friendly parrot costume and I went. Honestly, I was having a blast. I really felt like I was connecting with the whole idea, I completely understood the appeal. I even made some new friends. I just got so caught up in the whole idea, I ended up going back to a hotel with a group of them. And you know, of course, before long things started getting hot and heavy. Next to me was someone in a seahorse costume making out with what looked like probably a specific creature from a TV show. On the floor was a lynx, a fox, and also a cat. And there I was, a big friendly parrot, just going to town with some dog. The dog was giving me strong vibes, we just had great chemistry. We just were going to town, and right in the heat of passion, wouldn't you know it, the dog's head rolled off. Absolutely stunned, I yelled, "By god - that's not a Rottweiler! That's my wife!"

A: every time i see something like this, i can't help but think that they act that way, or exaggerate these ticks. from a definition of ["tourette syndrome"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourette_syndrome): > Coprolalia (the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette's, but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. or maybe all of these 10% are comedians?

A: I understand why you would doubt it, seems fairly ridiculous. It is not exaggerated, I just happen to be in that 10% category. I also let it happen when I am on stage, so I don't try to hold it back. The issue with holding it back would be that it would build up and then come out all at once. I do have significantly less Tourette's when I am relaxed and not on stage in front of people telling jokes, so the nerves play a large part in amping up the tics.

A: I would absolutely do so, the trouble is that I would need a touring headliner comedian to ask me to do that for them. I don't think it would be financially viable to try to headline currently, since I'm not sure I have enough exposure to get people to come out, but hopefully that wouldn't be too far down the road. The amount of money per set really depends on a ton of factors, including tickets sold, venue size, name, location, etc. I think my main path currently would hopefully be for online exposure to help get me work writing for TV, which would be a way to do comedy for a living, while working on stand-up on the side. That's very supportive of you to ask that by the way, thank you!

A: Of course man! I'm on a similar grind as a musician, so am pretty sympathetic to the struggle. We're doing our first tour this August and will likely lose money, or at best break even-but we're looking at it as a promotional cost. We'll hopefully get some extra press, maybe local radio play, etc. Obviously its different than comedy, but I hope you get to do more of that soon! Surf's Up!

I'm glad it wasn't distracting, I'm able to basically hold most of the tension of the tics while telling a joke, and then release it between, so I get into a sort of back & forth rhythm with it.

A: Yeah definitely, I usually use the blinking comparison. Most of the time when you blink, it's just sort of automatic, but you CAN hold it. When you do hold it, you feel like you really need to blink, so then afterwards you have to blink a whole bunch.

Q: Just curious, how long could you theoretically hold it? And what exactly is the experience when you do hold it off? Like with blinking you get pain in your eyes - is their pain somewhere if you hold the ticks off?
A: That's interesting, I've actually never timed it out. When it's less active, I can go for like a fairly long time, up to an hour even, before I have a larger tic. When it's stronger though, like on stage, I could probably hold it for about a minute before bursting out. Holding feels like a very specific weird tension that's hard to describe, I suppose like having an itch, but not specifically painful and more like frustrating, if that makes sense. Agitating? You know when you have too much sugar and you get sort of agitated, I feel like it can be like that. Usually when I hold it, like on the train or something, I mostly actually just hold back the vocal tics and essentially go into vibrate mode. I'm not fully holding it back, just sort of redirecting the tics.

Q: Are the tics uncomfortable? It looks like they are just exhausting to manage.
A: They can be, but the generally are more just in the way. They get uncomfortable when I do the same one for too long so the muscle gets tired, or if I hurt myself lol. I tend to only get hurt if I hit myself too hard, if I end up flailing into something, or if I jerk my neck and pull that muscle. For the most part though, they tend to just feel more like a typical fidget, and can even feel good because I'm releasing the tension.

A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well. Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

Q: Are your tics that constant, or does being on-stage and being anxious/nervous have something to do with it? I don't know much about Tourettes, so this is an honest question.
A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.

A: That’s interesting, and makes sense, thanks for the reply. Your act is funny, and the bobble head joke you made in the comments here actually made me breathe air out my nose a little more quickly than usual, and I don’t really laugh at much, so that’s a big deal to me. You do a good job of moving through it in your act. So the “shit motherfucker” tic, is that a conscious choice to use those words in particular? I remember when “Tourette’s Guy” had those YouTube videos and a lot of people said that the whole “uncontrollable swearing” from people with Tourette’s is kind of a meme, and isn’t really that common of a tic. I guess what I’m asking is, are those words always the ones that you say in tics? Or does it change to other words? And did you “choose” those words? Like I said I really don’t know much about Tourette’s so I’m not trying to be rude or anything I’m just interested. I have read about it but never had to opportunity to talk to anyone who actually has it. (Edit: you don’t have to talk about it either if you don’t want to, sorry, I know that’s not really why you posted the video and I’m not trying to take away from your comedy video, I’m just genuinely interested.)

A: Surf's up, I appreciate the interest! Feel free to ask whatever. The shit motherfucker is not a conscious choice. Those people were right, it isn't very common. Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, which is called Coprolalia, and that basically translates from Greek to "feces speech" from what I understand lol. I don't always say those words, but shit, fuck, and motherfucker are definitely my most common curses. I also say asshole pretty frequently as well, but my main tics are like the bodily movements and clicking noise. Also, very recently, I've been having this new tic where I just sort of speak like gibberish German or Dutch, and it's super funny, but also not cursing (as far as I know lol).

A: Thanks for the education man. Your act is good because you work the Tourette’s tics into it in a funny way, but your jokes are also funny aside from it, and not dependent on it. A lot of comics with “disabilities” kind of rely really heavy on them, which is only funny for so long. Yours is a good mix. Take care man.

I mean really, that was great on its own, your Tourette's is almost irrelevant to your set from my point of view. Very well done. You should be incredibly proud. I say this as someone who has done standup and has never gotten laughs like that, nor was I ever 10% as clever as that consistently.

A: Buffering is great, “Like streaming a special that won’t load/that’s always buffering.” That’s funny. You’re on to something there. I don’t think you need to address it at all if you don’t want to. Just the straight fact that you have Tourette’s at the beginning of your set so the audience is aware and then straight into the material I think would be fine. I don’t know why I’m offering all of this unsolicited advice. You know what to do better than me, that’s for sure. It was just an idea since you seem to call it out once in a while when you have a tick. Just another throwaway reference. Sorry to bother you.

A: Thank you! TS Represent. I hate the face and jaw ones hahaha, people think I am making fun of them. I actually got into comedy before I had Tourette's, and I got really lucky that one-liners is a style that is pretty conducive to allowing Tourette's during the set.

Q: How do people treat/deal with the unexpected syntoms of this disability in public?
A: Most people are aware of what Tourette's is, so they will just make it a point to ignore or not look at me. Sometimes I will catch people staring, or repeated stolen glances. Kids will flat out stare, I once overheard a kid ask her mom what was wrong with me and the mother kindly explained Tourette's to her. It can also depend on the word I say, like "Shit and Fuck" will get very little public reaction, but once in a while I will say "Faggot," and that will really take the air out of any situation.

A: Thank you! Not sure why cursing Tics are a thing actually. Most people (90% or more) with Tourette's actually don't have the cursing type. Also from what I understand, most people don't develop Tourette's until around 7 years old, so that might help explain the birth situation. I personally did not develop the severe cursing version until I was 21, which is uncommon.

A: As a follow Tourette's dude, good job getting yourself out there and not being afraid of showing everyone what you can do. Mine is mostly physical with occasional coughs, grunts, but luckily no verbal outburst. I know you have the shorter end of that stick. Mine is more active during stressful situations or if I am actively concentrating on other task and not trying to tamp down the tics. When you are on stage is this your most or least active state with your tics? Seems like the pressure of an audience and performing would ramp it up. With that said, I do a far amount of public speaking and can keep in controlled for the most part. Also how old are you...how do your tics compare now to when you were a teen? Mine where way worse as a teen (puberty / highschool stress) then now.

A: Thank you, Tourette's represent! Most active state is on stage for sure, second only to the moment I walk into a new place if I can tell people are looking at me lol, like right as I board a train. My tics were significantly lower as a teen, pretty much just simple humming and head twitches, I didn't even bother to think about it or get it diagnosed. It got significantly worse when I was 21, it slowly ramped up over the course of a few months

A: \- I joined the improv team in college because a friend of mine told me to, lol. I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

Q: What do you think?
A: I highly recommend you post this to /r/Standup or /r/StandUpComedy Your joke writing is really good. You don't even need tourettes jokes, you just have a mind for comedy. The "I saw a dog kill a mouse the other day." bit was perfect. I think you could do an entire set of one liners without even mentioning your tourettes, then end on an absolute killer of closer that brings it all together.

Q: Weird question, but how does a tic feel? With the twitch I wonder if you're in pain. And do you remember what you said immediately afterwards?
A: Feels sort of like a sudden muscle tensing, or a build up and release of mental tension! That can all happen very fast too, so I don't always feel the build coming. I sometimes look like I'm in pain, but it's only painful if I jerk my neck or do the same movement for a long time. I always remember what I said as well!

Q: How often do your verbal ticks change? Or did it manifest after you learned shit motherfucker?
A: For most of my life my vocal tics were mostly just humming and throat clearing, and then when I was 21 it switched to cursing! I would say it's been fairly consistently the same few curses, with the occasional increase in an unusual one, like the F slur for the lgbt+ community. That one seems to be the most variable in the last few months for me, either being fairly often or not at all.

A: Great Stuff! It's refreshing to see an open micer who can actually write a quality joke! You kind of have a head start having Tourette's Syndrome. In the sense that you cannot help but be authentic up there, much less own it, and have fun with it. Not that TS is who you are of course, but it's a great way to show your vulnerable side and build rapport with the audience. In this regard you have a leg up, but your material is clearly miles above most beginners, so you truly do have a lot going for you! You are open, honest, and comfortable on stage and you are naturally funny! It really does seem like you would go very far in comedy!

A: Thank you!! That's all very kind, I appreciate that. I definitely use the Tourette's as a foot in the door (and then my foot shakes lol). Then beyond that, I just try to only rely on jokes, and not the Tourette's, because just harking on the TS would be a very boring gimmick

A: Only like 10&#37; of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called [Coprolalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia), which literally means feces talk. Most people just do various noises or bodily movements. I think it is because of how hard hitting they are, like they are the most powerful way to get rid of the energy. It's like if you stubbed your toe, your mind prefers to curse, you know? I rarely have non-curse word Tourette's and I'm honestly not always sure if it even is, because of how regular words just blend in with conversation. Jess Thom, a British comedian with Tourette's, says "Biscuits" regularly, and it's pretty clear that hers is actually a tic. Thank you!! Mitch Hedberg is my favorite

Q: Do you ever fake ticks during a set? Sometimes they seem intentional and funny but I didn't want to laugh if it was a legitimate tick.
A: Nope! I get this question a lot actually, which makes sense. I absolutely let them happen though, like I don't hold them back between jokes, but I definitely never purposefully tic during a set. I think that's why it looks fake, because it's a clear pattern of me holding it during a joke, me ticcing, hold, tic, hold, etc. I have faked them in class before though! I was the only student who was allowed to get away with just yelling MOTHERFUCKER, so once in a while I would do it just for fun lol

A: My neck muscles can get super sore if I have the head shaking Tourette's a lot, but most days I am not in enough high excitement situations for it to be too much of an issue. Most of what I do is facial twitches, and that can really mess with my eyes and contacts, causing them to water up a bunch, but that's more annoying than anything.

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm gonna tell you a story that shook the Czech Republic, regarding Tourettes (hopefully it won't get buried). Trust me, it's worth a read. There's this show, Come Dine With Me, where five competitors each make the others dinner one day and they compete to be the best cook of them. On March 23rd, the most legendary of episodes was aired. It involved a host with Tourettes, permanent erection, granny fetish, chicken as a pet and coffin for a bed. It was insane, many people thought he was hired by the TV to increase views. He was indeed fake, but not hired by the TV, he was there for a recess group called [Onemanshow](https://www.stream.cz/porady/onemanshow) (Czech link), who specialise in such pranks as [fake video of Justin Bieber getting pantsed](http://www.tmz.com/2016/11/18/justin-bieber-pantsed-fans/), fake [Jim Carrey coming on the stage of prestigious Czech movie awards](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/24/fake-jim-carrey-unmasked-at-czech-film-awards), smuggling themselves into Russia in a škoda car that was exhibited at the Hockey Championship (and creating a [fake video of an American fan pissing into Datsyuk's shoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZABXjtqfdQI&user=fireprofcargo)) and many more. Back to Come Dine. This guy (Karel) has none of these things I described, he is in reality a totally normal amateur actor. That appartment with chicken and a coffin was not even his. It also was not a 2+1 as it seemed on the show, but a 4+1. Where did the two rooms go you ask? well, they became [the secret Onemanshow headquarters of course](http://imgur.com/63Fgmet)! Kazma (the leader of the show) and some other guys locked themselves in total darkness and silence in there for 17 hours. One sound and it's all fucked. In the kitchen and dining room (middle top and middle bottom respectively), there were two large mirrors. And if you know how two way mirrors work, you can probably figure out why they were there. So he cooked, but he can't cook at all. How do we make him cook without him making an absolute fool out of himself and probably jeopardizing the whole operation? Well, first off you create a hole in the wall behind the oven. Second of all, you make a special oven that doesn't work but has a door that opens in the back. Third, that door leads into your backstage. Fourth, you get three of the country's best chefs cooking similar foods to what he is, except they use the best ingredients in a restaurant located near the appartment (Karel can use like whatever to make it *look* vaguely similar). Fifth, use a pulley to deliver the good food from the chefs to the backstage and carefully (and quietly) switch them in the super oven. That's not all, one of his competitors accidentally locked himself inside the coffin bed. Well... accidentally... There actually were *two* fake competitors in the show. However, they didn't use this power to win it and get $2000. No. The best part? If Onemanshow didn't release their video showing off all this, *literally nobody would have known.* The reason they did all this is that one of their team members also has Tourettes. For the longest time they were looking for a way to help him, but didn't know how. A lot of Czechs didn't even know what the syndrome is and creating an awareness ad that runs for at least the entire week on primetime would costs hundrets of thousands. But with Come Dine, "tourettes" has become the \#1 search term on the czech internet. Their video describing this massive project broke records and gained 3.5 million views on a website made for a 10 million nation. It's literally bonkers.

He was indeed fake, but not hired by the TV, he was there for a recess group called [Onemanshow](https://www.stream.cz/porady/onemanshow) (Czech link), who specialise in such pranks as [fake video of Justin Bieber getting pantsed](http://www.tmz.com/2016/11/18/justin-bieber-pantsed-fans/), fake [Jim Carrey coming on the stage of prestigious Czech movie awards](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/24/fake-jim-carrey-unmasked-at-czech-film-awards), smuggling themselves into Russia in a škoda car that was exhibited at the Hockey Championship (and creating a [fake video of an American fan pissing into Datsyuk's shoe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZABXjtqfdQI&user=fireprofcargo)) and many more. Back to Come Dine. This guy (Karel) has none of these things I described, he is in reality a totally normal amateur actor. That appartment with chicken and a coffin was not even his. It also was not a 2+1 as it seemed on the show, but a 4+1. Where did the two rooms go you ask? well, they became [the secret Onemanshow headquarters of course](http://imgur.com/63Fgmet)! Kazma (the leader of the show) and some other guys locked themselves in total darkness and silence in there for 17 hours. One sound and it's all fucked. In the kitchen and dining room (middle top and middle bottom respectively), there were two large mirrors. And if you know how two way mirrors work, you can probably figure out why they were there. So he cooked, but he can't cook at all. How do we make him cook without him making an absolute fool out of himself and probably jeopardizing the whole operation? Well, first off you create a hole in the wall behind the oven. Second of all, you make a special oven that doesn't work but has a door that opens in the back. Third, that door leads into your backstage. Fourth, you get three of the country's best chefs cooking similar foods to what he is, except they use the best ingredients in a restaurant located near the appartment (Karel can use like whatever to make it *look* vaguely similar). Fifth, use a pulley to deliver the good food from the chefs to the backstage and carefully (and quietly) switch them in the super oven. That's not all, one of his competitors accidentally locked himself inside the coffin bed. Well... accidentally... There actually were *two* fake competitors in the show. However, they didn't use this power to win it and get $2000. No. The best part? If Onemanshow didn't release their video showing off all this, *literally nobody would have known.* The reason they did all this is that one of their team members also has Tourettes. For the longest time they were looking for a way to help him, but didn't know how. A lot of Czechs didn't even know what the syndrome is and creating an awareness ad that runs for at least the entire week on primetime would costs hundrets of thousands. But with Come Dine, "tourettes" has become the \#1 search term on the czech internet. Their video describing this massive project broke records and gained 3.5 million views on a website made for a 10 million nation. It's literally bonkers.
A: ah, that's very bonkers

A: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well. Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

A: \- I joined the improv team in college because a friend of mine told me to, lol. I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

Q: Wait so why does people with this syndrome Tend to curse a lot? So are there people with Tourette’s that say nice things instead of cursing ?
A: Nobody knows why! Only like 10% of people with tourette's have the cursing type. A lot of other people either say other things, have mostly body tics, or have various other vocal tics like barking. There's a famous british comedian named Jess Thom who has tourette's where she says "Biscuits"

A: Honest critique? It looks like you are going up to do a(ass!) set. Work on being more natural on stage. Otherwise great job incorporating tics(that bitch!) and having finishers on tics that interrupt(cocksucker!) jokes. Just my humble opinion. Mind you I've only see this one video and don't know the "natural you" but that's my observation from a person that's a different kind of broken. eit: all things in parenthesis are at the suggestion of my wife... I couldn't not.

A: Thank you!! Great question, and my neck generally doesn't get sore, but I do sometimes pull the muscle and that will hurt a bunch for a few minutes. When that happens on stage, I just have to take a long pause before I continue and push through it, but it usually subsides quickly. My face gets the most sore, but I don't do much about that. My wrist gets more like hurt the most often. I've been wearing a brace for my wrist sometimes recently, to sort of help with a more recent tic I've been having where I aggressively shake my hand (usually the left).

Q: What do you think?
A: Can you elaborate on the specific choice of words in your ticks? Are they words that you involuntarily pronounce? I’ve assumed that because it’s an involuntary tick that makes some words just kinda flow, but is there anything special about “shit motherfucker” over say “cumbucket trashdick” ? Does “shit motherfucker” have a personal, or specific, appeal? Also do you ever get scared to pick your nose?

Does “shit motherfucker” have a personal, or specific, appeal? Also do you ever get scared to pick your nose?
A: Great question, and for sure, there are definitely particular words that sort of scratch the itch in a very particular way, if that makes sense. A good way to relate to it is when you stub your toe, you don't go "Hello yes good day," you go "Fucking shit fuck." I think it's a similar part of the brain being activated. Some people though are able to redirect that and say other words, like when you stub your toe and try not to curse. That mental sensation (not including the pain of the toe) is sort of what it feels like when I try to hold it in, or redirect it. I'm not sure why those are my words in particular, but for some reason Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass are my main vocal tics besides the clicking noise. (maybe that's a curse in a different language? lol) As for picking my nose, I do not get scared and if anything, am too brazen! Lol, I haven't had any issues besides the usual tics there, but I can usually feel them coming ahead of time. The biggest face issue is when I am wearing glasses, I will tend to accidentally shake them off my head.

A: Thanks for the explanation! That nervous tick you express with words aloud is honestly close to how my inner monologue expresses anxiety internally! Like not having a mute switch for internal anxieties haha, talk about wearing your heart on your sleeve lol. Ever think about wearing glasses near cute girls and “accidentally” shake them off towards them ? Seems like a great opener! Follow up question if you have time: how is dating situations with having ticks when nervous? I’m laughing at the idea of being unsure about going in for a kiss and accidentally giraffe-head butting your honey (if that unfortunate incident could hold any traction).

A: Hahahaha, so dating is actually where the tics are a huge issue at first. Especially flirting, I feel like that is probably when I have the most tourette's, even worse than on stage. I actually have this tic where I punch myself in the face sometimes. Not like a hard punch, but an expected series of knuckle to cheek repetitive movements, and if I am flirting with someone, that's probably the most intrusive and even scariest one to have. Actually dating though is a lot more okay, because once someone knows I have tourette's, they aren't put off by the tics. It is very funny though, to be making out with someone and then suddenly yell MOTHERFUCKER in their face. I have accidentally punched people a few times! Never head butted anybody though, which is surprising.

A: I’m belly laughing right now! Share and intimate moment followed by yelling MOTHERFUCKER in their face! Despite the obvious comedic value of your experiences, I want to express a deep empathy for your anxieties and your experiences. Sometimes being a funny guy can make people feel it’s okay to just laugh at all your pain, and while it might be invited, you’re still a person with a serious side and that deserves to be respected also. All in all you’ve made my Saturday! I live in Stroudsburg, PA and am definitely looking out for any shows that you might be doing in the future! Here’s hoping you shake things up in the comedy world!

Q: I’d love to see you tell an really long antijoke, like norm McDonald’s moth joke.
A: Well, so I had actually been married for a few years to this gal. Honestly, things were going great for a good while, but then over time I began to feel like she was growing more distant, like we were growing apart. I thought maybe she was hiding something from me, you know, like she was spending all this time on the computer. I wanted to know what she was up to, you know, and one day when she left the computer open, I just took a quick glance. She had open a bunch of tabs of Furry art twitter accounts, and was in like Furry fetish subreddits. Certainly not in my wheel house, you know, but I mean she was my wife, so I did my own research. Turned out, there was a Furry convention coming to town in like a week or so. So, I got this big friendly parrot costume and I went. Honestly, I was having a blast. I really felt like I was connecting with the whole idea, I completely understood the appeal. I even made some new friends. I just got so caught up in the whole idea, I ended up going back to a hotel with a group of them. And you know, of course, before long things started getting hot and heavy. Next to me was someone in a seahorse costume making out with what looked like probably a specific creature from a TV show. On the floor was a lynx, a fox, and also a cat. And there I was, a big friendly parrot, just going to town with some dog. The dog was giving me strong vibes, we just had great chemistry. We just were going to town, and right in the heat of passion, wouldn't you know it, the dog's head rolled off. Absolutely stunned, I yelled, "By god - that's not a Rottweiler! That's my wife!"

Q: Have you not always had Tourette's and how do you "get" it? I was under the minimally educated impression it was a lifetime disorder. Good stuff, I liked your set.
A: Hey, good question, I had no idea either. So, I had a milder form of undiagnosed Tourette's growing up, but it became far more severe when I was 21. A lot of people with Tourette's develop or "get" it when they are between the ages of 7-14. It often significantly fades or lessens for good by the time they are no longer teens, but if it comes back or worsens then it is likely to stay. Hope that helped clear it up. Also, thanks!

Q: I guess the one thing I am always curious about is why is it swearing that is a tic (at least that is the trope)? Why not just random words?
A: Only like 10&#37; of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called coprolalia, and I think the trope is swearing because that is the most jarring one. Some people do just say random words, like there is a British comedian named Jess Thom who says "Biscuits."

A: Were you always saying shit motha fucka? Was it something else growing up or was it developed later on?

Q: Were you always saying shit motha fucka? Was it something else growing up or was it developed later on?
A: From ages like 7-21, I pretty much just had a milder head twitch and occasional humming / throat noises that weren't even diagnosed as Tourette's. But then when I was 21, I started to develop the curses and the stronger body tics. While I have had the cursing tics though, it's been fairly consistently Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass, and sometimes I say a few worse words. The most intense word I say consistently is the F slur for the queer community, and I've only said the n-word a handful of times. I have never said bitch, cunt, dick, penis, general dirty stuff, or most racial slurs. I say piece of shit and asshole pretty often too.

A: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well. Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

Q: Are your tics that constant, or does being on-stage and being anxious/nervous have something to do with it? I don't know much about Tourettes, so this is an honest question.
A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.

A: That’s interesting, and makes sense, thanks for the reply. Your act is funny, and the bobble head joke you made in the comments here actually made me breathe air out my nose a little more quickly than usual, and I don’t really laugh at much, so that’s a big deal to me. You do a good job of moving through it in your act. So the “shit motherfucker” tic, is that a conscious choice to use those words in particular? I remember when “Tourette’s Guy” had those YouTube videos and a lot of people said that the whole “uncontrollable swearing” from people with Tourette’s is kind of a meme, and isn’t really that common of a tic. I guess what I’m asking is, are those words always the ones that you say in tics? Or does it change to other words? And did you “choose” those words? Like I said I really don’t know much about Tourette’s so I’m not trying to be rude or anything I’m just interested. I have read about it but never had to opportunity to talk to anyone who actually has it. (Edit: you don’t have to talk about it either if you don’t want to, sorry, I know that’s not really why you posted the video and I’m not trying to take away from your comedy video, I’m just genuinely interested.)

A: Surf's up, I appreciate the interest! Feel free to ask whatever. The shit motherfucker is not a conscious choice. Those people were right, it isn't very common. Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, which is called Coprolalia, and that basically translates from Greek to "feces speech" from what I understand lol. I don't always say those words, but shit, fuck, and motherfucker are definitely my most common curses. I also say asshole pretty frequently as well, but my main tics are like the bodily movements and clicking noise. Also, very recently, I've been having this new tic where I just sort of speak like gibberish German or Dutch, and it's super funny, but also not cursing (as far as I know lol).

A: Thank you!! Glad you checked out the other material as well. So I actually have some sort of late on-set tic disorder, I didn't get the more intense tics until I was 21. I had much milder bodily tics and some small vocal tics starting when I was 7, but the cursing and heavy movements were a late development. By the time I was 21, there were no new words to learn! (except maybe cuck? lmao, I think I've said that a few times since it entered my mind) It seems to be some sort of weird genetics, one of my relatives also got late onset tic disorder at the age of 18.

A: Yes and no! I am used to the idea of having Tourette's, but I am still not used to the random outbursts that take me by surprise, which can sometimes be loud or very unwanted. I am very used to the public awkwardness of it to a certain degree though, like I just punch myself in the face on the train regularly and I'm used to people taking notice, but honestly, people don't really care that much because they see weird shit all the time.

A: - Yes, but not nearly as bad off stage. It gets way worse when I am anxious / nervous / stressed, such as when I'm doing stand-up. - I have body tourette's in my sleep, but not vocal, which is neat - Other times it gets worse are when I have caffeine, sugar, or am in a heightened emotional state like being angry, or as I am initially sexually aroused lol. - I actually have breathing Tourette's! Sometimes I literally stop breathing for a solid thirty seconds randomly. - I am very mildly Touretting right now as I type this, just stuff like arm twitches and face, occasional bark or curse

A: I have turrets and also did a a brief stint as a stand up comedian as well. When I would perform, my tics would disappear. The minute I got off the stage, they'd come back. Why do you think that is not the case with you? How much of your performance is you actually playing off of the tics, and not an uncontrollable action? Do your tics get worse when you are not performing?

A: The trouble is that they are so strong, they build up too quickly, so I can hold them in briefly, but then I would just get absolutely overwhelmed by an avalanche of tics. I do let them happen on stage, mostly to relieve the tension, but also so I can riff. I never fake or force them though, it's all chance. My tics are significantly more relaxed when I am not performing.

A: Thank you! The bottle riff was not intentional, that was just pure luck, but I do have some of the riffs semi planned. The thing is, certain tics have to happen before I can do the riffs. The Zelda noise one is actually one I have done before, and I only do that riff if I happen to have that specific noise tic while I'm on stage. Performing actually makes them worse! I am very nervous and full of adrenaline when I am performing, so the moments when it is less intense are when I start to feel more relaxed. Lol, I will look that rapper up, that's a funny name

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?

A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol. This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.

A: [There was a study about cursing and pain](https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-why-swearing-physically-reduces-pain/) that basically showed cursing allowed for a higher pain tolerance. I've wondered if that would extrapolate to tics, where using curses would effectively allow for a stronger release of the "tic energy" (for lack of a better term). I know after I have a tic, I can internally feel a slight internal relaxing of my mind and body. If I hold for longer, the release sensation is a little stronger, etc., so maybe that's part of the relation? Great set btw, that's original stuff you should be proud of. Also, I'm glad you didn't make TS the focus of the jokes, I think you'll do way better keeping your style as it is. I've seen comics that focus everything on an oddity about them, and that gets old quick. What you did incorporating TS in a handful of lines and improv lines was a perfect mix!

A: This is awesome - My favorite part was the message in the bottle riff, funny how that part got more laughs than the punchline. Was that intentional? Either way keep it up. I noticed there were parts of your show where your ticks were less intense, does performing help with them? I know of a rapper named "Scroobius Pip" who has a serious stutter that disappears while he's rapping.

A: Thank you! The bottle riff was not intentional, that was just pure luck, but I do have some of the riffs semi planned. The thing is, certain tics have to happen before I can do the riffs. The Zelda noise one is actually one I have done before, and I only do that riff if I happen to have that specific noise tic while I'm on stage. Performing actually makes them worse! I am very nervous and full of adrenaline when I am performing, so the moments when it is less intense are when I start to feel more relaxed. Lol, I will look that rapper up, that's a funny name

A: They definitely change over time, I would say it's usually longer though. A new word might crop up every several months, but the main words like "shit" and "fuck" and all them have been fairly consistent for a long time. Most of the things that change more frequently are body tics, those seem to crop up with new ones about once a month, if not more often. Some things come and go, and some things return after a while. Surf's up is not a tic actually, I can see why people thought that, that's just me saying a fun silly thing that I enjoy. Lol I hope in an apocalypse bunker somewhere eventually, they will have rows of food and water in their shelter, and then a dvd copy of my stand up Thanks!

A: All the comments are creepy nice. You're funny, no doubt, but everyone is treating you like a hot chick that they want to fuck. Notice the bizarre exclamation point (!) count in this comment thread, over 300 (not including your "thank you!"s). **(I mention this because it's internet doctrine that "!" is the symbol used by white people culture online when they're being fake)** People feel a moral imperative to find you funny because of your disability. The fact that you are actually funny creates this dopey cognitive dissonance. Many of the comments are half-fake, and half-genuine, or genuine but written like they're fake. This is like some Twilight Zone Shit going on. Jesus, the top comment by /u/FILTHY_GOBSHITE : >You've got a lot of stage presence and charisma, really likeable. Keep that shit up. Cringey as fuck. It's like the comment version of a person with Botox trying to smile. You're actually good so you don't need to be some peasant eating validations scraps at the table that boring fucks like him are tossing you. My point, own it. Own all of this. Use it. Recognize this behavior and draw humor from it. For someone with Tourettes I am surprised at your lack of on-stage awareness of it. You make a joke here or there, but nothing deep. Is it because you think it's an easy target? Your audience is filled with these stray emotions ready for you to manipulate. Their guilt, their judging.. etc. Consider things in the (vague) vein of: 1. ".. That was a shit joke, don't worry you're allowed to not laugh, it's not quite beating up a retarded person, but you're still a terrible human being" 2. "Even if you don't find me funny you'll earn like 50 Karma by sticking around. You'll still be reborn mosquito but at least you won't be shit on " 3. "I was in special needs class. I sat next to a kid that ate shit, because I say SHIT. There is no justice in this world" You're probably cleverer than me so maybe you thought this through already, and you could certainly come up with better examples, but I think it'd be cool if you entertain that direction a bit.

A: Great points. Let's talk some good ol reddit theory. Yeah, I would agree that many of the comments are more positive than the actual emotions people might be having. I think it's for two main reasons. First is that people are obviously trying to be kind, as a means of encouraging me to continue doing what I'm doing, which is something I greatly appreciate. And also because hopefully they legitimately are kind people who enjoyed the comedy. Second is that I am the content creator, and I am actively reading and replying to these comments. People probably don't want to actively insult someone they think will legitimately read what they write. Now about the exclamation points!! I could see how they are viewed as fake, but I do want to say "Thank you" every time people are kind, and I feel like "Thank you." is too curt. So I went with "Thank you!" As an initial opener to set tone, and then I try to follow that with actual responses. About the set, I do in fact think certain Tourette's jokes would be too easy. Last thing, if you want to see some way more brutal comments, check out the world star version someone uploaded lol, those comments are vicious. Edit: I changed the exclamation points part's phrasing

A: Thank you, I appreciate that! I am an aspiring comedian, I perform often in Philadelphia, probably about once a week or every other. That's an interesting question that sort of stumped me for a moment, I would say the literal tick sound does help stop the compulsions, but that is because it is a compulsion itself. It's just a shorter, stronger burst of one, so it gets rid of the energy more efficiently than shaking or tapping.

Title: Do any of you guys surf?

Body: I saw a Benny Feldman video today where he used the phase "surf's up" for some reason. It reminded me of a time when I used to surf with a guy with Tourettes pretty regularly. I was always amazed by how he could be ticking quite badly, then take off on a wave and his ticks would completely disappear until he finished the wave. Then they'd come back, but they wouldn't be as intense as before he'd ridden the wave. Another thing I noticed was that, when we were surfing spots that had really long waves, his ticks would disappear for the entire duration of the wave, even if it was an exceptionally long ride.


Anyway, I'm really interested to hear if any of you surf and what your experiences are with it.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: - I don't tourette's as much off stage because I am far more relaxed - If I am ticcing too much, I can usually hold it in for brief periods of time, or direct it to different parts of my body. Trouble with holding it in is that it builds up and becomes worse later

A: \- I joined the improv team in college because a friend of mine told me to, lol. I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

A: I'd like to point out to people (Way too late) that TS does not always induce vocal tics (such as saying "shit motherfucker" compulsively) it's a symptom called coprolalia that often goes hand in hand with tourettes but isn't always the case. Please refer to: https://www.tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia/ or other medical resources if you'd like to educate yourself.

A: You can buy quite a selection of CBD products very readily in NJ. Sold at a number of smoke and vape shops. I recently bought CBD Hemp Flower. Looks, smells, and smokes just like weed (because it is weed, seriously, no fake stuff). No head high, but you can feel the medical effects hitting you.

Q: Hey Benny, I have a couple questions about Tourette’s that I wonder if you’d mind answering?
A: For sure!

Q: For sure!
A: Awesome, thank you, and please forgive what may seem like incredible ignorance on my end for the questions that follow. I understand that the tics and cursing are completely involuntary, and that their intensity and expression vary from person to person, like how some people bark. What I’m curious about is whether there’s a moment of conscious thought that precedes the verbal stuff. Like, does your brain think, “Shit!” and then it just comes out, or is there a complete disconnect? And on that note, do you know if there are cases where people blurt out especially pleasant things? It seems that the tics people with Tourette’s have always contain a sort of “aggressive” element, whether that’s cursing or barking or whatever. Lastly, I don’t want to write something so base and cliché as saying you’re “brave” for getting up on stage with your condition, but it really does take some serious guts to not give a fuck, to know who you are and be cool with that, to expose aspects of yourself to the world that some may find uncomfortable. You’re rad

A: No worries! For the tics, I have never once thought "Shit" and then said it, because those are pretty much always a very quick sudden burst. However, with compulsions (slower, more OCD based sensation), I will actively think "Holy fuck I really want to touch that thing over there with the heel of my foot." They are similar sensations, but the speed and intensity of it are different, where tics are like a sudden burst and compulsions are a wave. Not sure how pleasant this is, or if it is pleasant on purpose, but a British comedian named Jess Thom yells out "Biscuits." There might be an undercurrent of aggression for her as well, but I'm not sure. Thank you a ton! I really appreciate that. Right on and surf's up forever

Q: I'm sure you've been asked before but does weed or CBD oil help?
A: I have tried a few CBD gummies, but they are fairly low dose, so I want to try the actual oil. Weed though tends to make me anxious or have panic attacks (bad for tourette's lol), so I want to get a medical license and try strains with lower THC

A: Yeah I would imagine there might be a strain curated to the condition itself. I just thought since it helps with epilepsy it might carry over to this too.

I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in.

A: CBD oil is great, but if weed makes you anxious, look to a different strain! I dont know what you've had, but I'm guessing it was a sativa? Sativa strains can make some people anxious, or give some people energy. Every person is different, but there is a strain for everyone! Try an indica. Proven to be a relaxing high in moderation 👌

A: I've not seen too many tourettes suffering comedians. Is this just me not looking for them, or are there not many out there? I know of Samuel J Comroe, who's pretty funny as well. I assume your ticks get worse as you get nervous? I was only given a small glimpse into your life with those few hillarious minutes, but it seemed that your ticks got worse as it went on. I might have been imagining it though. Would you say your ticks get worse the more nervous you are? Or do your ticks kind of die off as you enter the flow of the energy of the room? Or does it just stay the same regardless? I've heard of some sufferers who have no problems when they sing (though, that might be stutterers), so was just curious if the same thing would / could happen for you! Keep doing your thing! You're awesome.

A: Thank you!! I actually emailed Samuel J Comroe to challenge him to a duel, he was very kind and we plan to fight to the death at some point! My tics get way worse when I'm nervous, excited, stressed out, embarrased, etc. Going on stage and doing stand-up can be a lot of those things at once lol, it's like a shot of adrenaline. I don't think they match the energy of the room, but my emotions will react to the energy of the room, which can change them. I have no tics when I dance, weirdly enough! I don't know why, I think it's like a full body emotion thing, or being focused on my movements.

A: That's totally alright! I find them very funny as well. Sometimes audiences laugh at them from the get go, and I'm not a huge fan of that, I prefer when they get permission from me first in a way.

A: One of my nephews has Tourette's. He's 13 and a lot of his tics are very similar to yours, except he gulps air and pushes it through his throat like a frog instead of cussing. The more excited or nervous he gets, the more his tics pronounce themselves. He's never let it get in the way though, and I'm amazed. All his life, if anyone ever said something, he'd explain his condition as simply as if were his t-shirt. It's awesome. He's awesome. I'm not sure how many jokes he'll get, but I wanna show him this video anyway.

Q: Think? Lot'f of things. From the fact that it took you 24 hours to respond to the fact that every "tick" you supposedly have seems to happen conveniently right when you need them to. You are a liar.
A: I see your points. So, it took me 24 hours to respond because I have real world stuff to do. You'll notice a response gap for all of my posts starting around 5:30 yesterday when I went out with friends. The delay was not just for this post. As for the tics that happen when I need them, that's for two reasons: First is that I only do the tic punchlines (fuck the police) when a particular tic happens, such as "fuck." So they seem well timed, but they are actually reactionary. Second is because I try to let the Tourette's happen between jokes so that I can release the tension. If I don't, it may happen during the joke, which kills the delivery. I can hold it for brief periods of time, but it's like a tension that builds up. Best way to explain it, it's sort of like blinking. Most of the time you just blink whenever. But you can choose to hold your eyes open if you want to, but if you do so for an extended period of time, you feel like you really have to blink. So, I am letting myself 'blink' between jokes so I can 'hold my eyes open' during the jokes. I hope that helped explain it?

A: \- I joined the improv team in college because a friend of mine told me to, lol. I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

I know somebody already mentioned how much like Mitch hedberg you are but I just wanted to point out his stage fright. Somebody told me that's why he wore the big glasses but I didn't really get it until I saw a video one of his uncut sets where he spent the first 10-20 minutes of his set hiding from the camera guy and chilling with people in the front row. I also heard you say you don't want to just be known as the Tourette's comic but your Tourette's jokes usually land the most laughs because they are so personal and sincere plus people are bad with names and Bennny Fieldman is a little forgettable but "shit motherfucher louige" is memorable as fuck. If I were you I would definitely keep that mustache and always lead with that joke or some form of it. Also your merchandise sells itself. I already want a t-shirt with your face on it and the words shit motherfucker. If anyone calls the shirt offensive I can just be like its cool he has Tourette's. Also your one liners are fire.

A: It seems like Tourret’s is often related to saying things that you shouldn’t when you shouldn’t. It seems to often manifest as saying cuss words in public places, or making rude observations. Does it feel like your mind just is unable to hold back from saying things it shouldn’t? Or do the ticks just happen to be cussing often? I wonder what would happen if a child with Tourret’s was raised in such a way to minimize having a stigma associated with saying certain things... Awesome set! You had me laughing by myself which is saying something.

A: Thank you!! About the cursing, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called Coprolalia, which literally translates to feces speech lol. Most people with Touretet's just have milder vocal tics or body movements, and a lot of them aren't that noticeable. I think the media and TV amplifies up the version with cursing and socially unacceptable phrases because it's the most shocking. Personally, my cursing tics are almost never associated with the situation. However!!! My other ones are sometimes. I do have a clapping tic, and that one pretty much only happens either very ironically and it's rude for me to clap, or I'm genuinely suddenly happy. I also once yelled Sieg Heil at Rosh Hoshanah dinner lol. I'm not sure about the child experiment, but it's certainly interesting to note that kids in England with Tourette's will say stuff like Bollocks and Bloody Hell, according to some youtube video I watched

A: Yeah that was a bad generalization I made considering I had two friends with Tourette’s growing up but they both had more mild forms (well one was pretty heavily medicated), but both of them would kind of just hum under their breath a lot involuntarily, or touch things compulsively, and again, maybe the touching bit was part of something else, but I do know they both had Tourrete’s. Thanks for the info, but yeah, I’m still curious about whether or not people with Coprolalia and how the ticks seem to manifest more the more inappropriate the situation is, but maybe that’s just what I’ve seen on shows being edited to appear that way.

A: No worries on the generalization, I definitely used your question as a springboard to clear up that idea for other readers lol. I also have the touching Tourette's like your friend, and I think that could be more of an OCD behavior. I have a lot of symmetry based OCD, and I think the longer repetitive movements are from that as well. Sometimes my cursing tic will just happen to be at an inappropriate time, and I bet that's what TV would use for editing, so that makes a lot of sense.

A: Great stuff! Very smart of you to go the one liner route with your comedy. It really ends up working with your Tourette's, especially the way you're able to mesh them together. A few of questions if I may. (And not that this matters, but I'm the father of a child with a tic disorder) Do you have a few standard interjections you use with some of your more common verbal tics stored in your back pocket, or is it all off the cuff? (The UTI bit as a for instance.) Do you ever purposefully give to a tic, or even steer into one a little because you have something that it will play into as part of the routine? (Kind of ties into the first question.) Do you focus mainly on shorter sets, like this, or do you do longer sets as well? (The set was great, but my appetite was just getting whetted.) Finally, who are some current comedians you'd like to do a show with?

Finally, who are some current comedians you'd like to do a show with?
A: Thank you!! That's very kind, tell your child I said, "Surf's up forever" Exactly right about the riffs, some of them are basically stock lines that I use when I have specific tics, and some of them are off the cuff. The UTI bit is one I've done a bunch of times, and I basically have to hope that I have the right tic in order to do it, in that case some version of "Shit Fuck" or "Fucking shit." Luckily for that riff, that's a fairly frequent tic variation I have. That should also sort of answer the second question. I do not lean into or steer into any tic in particular to get a riff out, but I have previously, especially to try material. It just feels dishonest, and I feel like there's already concern about the reality of it to begin with. A lot of people already seem to think Tourette's is completely fake. (Now that I've said that though, I'm also thinking that I might lean into the right ones still, but subconsciously. I'ma think more about this lol) I focus almost exclusively on the jokes themselves, and then turn to build a set of whatever length by combining however many jokes I need to fill that time. It's basically not terribly different for me to work on five minutes or 10 minutes, I pretty much just need double the jokes. I'd love to film some longer sets in the future though! Currently, I'd love to work with Joe Pera or Julio Torres!

Q: Were you always saying shit motha fucka? Was it something else growing up or was it developed later on?
A: From ages like 7-21, I pretty much just had a milder head twitch and occasional humming / throat noises that weren't even diagnosed as Tourette's. But then when I was 21, I started to develop the curses and the stronger body tics. While I have had the cursing tics though, it's been fairly consistently Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass, and sometimes I say a few worse words. The most intense word I say consistently is the F slur for the queer community, and I've only said the n-word a handful of times. I have never said bitch, cunt, dick, penis, general dirty stuff, or most racial slurs. I say piece of shit and asshole pretty often too.

Q: Why wouldn't that have been diagnosed as Tourette's? And is development like this normal?
A: It probably would have been, but it was never severe enough for us to go to a neurologist until I was older. This is not normal, most people get tourette's from 7-14 and then it gets milder or even goes away, but sometimes it can stay the same, or in my case, get worse lol.

A: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well. Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

A: I guess the one thing I am always curious about is why is it swearing that is a tic (at least that is the trope)? Why not just random words?

Q: I guess the one thing I am always curious about is why is it swearing that is a tic (at least that is the trope)? Why not just random words?
A: Only like 10&#37; of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called coprolalia, and I think the trope is swearing because that is the most jarring one. Some people do just say random words, like there is a British comedian named Jess Thom who says "Biscuits."

A: Interesting. Do they know the mechanic behind it? I have tried to understand it but it seems complicated. Tics always seem to be so oddly specific.

A: I don't think they have a solid explanation yet, I have heard it might be a serotonin imbalance. I have also heard that the cursing part of your brain is wired differently than the rest of language, so that may also play a part in the cursing type of Tourette's. Apparently, most (all currently?) Tourette's medicine is mainly to treat other things, like anxiety, in the hopes that it also helps with the Tourette's

Q: What do you think?
A: Last year, I was diagnosed with a tic disorder that showed up as a co-morbid disorder to ADHD, so I know the struggle with the motor tic part all too well. Do you find that if you suppress the tics that it leads to some anxiety and then they flare up later? I often worry about what people will think of me if I tic in class or in public, so I tend to suppress it and then it gets worse later. It’s pretty inspiring to see you take it in stride like that.

A: Good question, I'm not sure! I heard somewhere that curse words are a different part of your brain than regular language, so maybe something to do with that? Sometimes a good solid guttural shout or grunt will relieve the pressure for me, anything sort of aggressive. Most people with Tourette's (90% or so) don't curse actually, they just make a variety of noises and have body tics. Sometimes they say non-curse words as well, like there's a lady who is famous for saying "biscuits." Hope that explains anything lol

I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!
A: CBD oil is great, but if weed makes you anxious, look to a different strain! I dont know what you've had, but I'm guessing it was a sativa? Sativa strains can make some people anxious, or give some people energy. Every person is different, but there is a strain for everyone! Try an indica. Proven to be a relaxing high in moderation 👌

A: Dude that shit is funny as hell! I have tourettes too and it makes me happy to see you owning it like this! I don't necessarily have any vocal ticks but more grunts with facial ticks. Like sometimes it feels like my face and jaw are trying to rip themselves off of my body. Makes for interesting first impressions to say the least. Can you tell me what your reason for getting into comedy was and how it seems so natural for you to work your ticks and vocalizations into your set? Because it totally works. I've tried open mic comedy a handful of times and I was always worried my facial ticks would distract from my jokes. Anyway, keep it up man, you're hilarious!

A: Thank you! TS Represent. I hate the face and jaw ones hahaha, people think I am making fun of them. I actually got into comedy before I had Tourette's, and I got really lucky that one-liners is a style that is pretty conducive to allowing Tourette's during the set.

Q: Are your tics that constant, or does being on-stage and being anxious/nervous have something to do with it? I don't know much about Tourettes, so this is an honest question.
A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.

A: That’s interesting, and makes sense, thanks for the reply. Your act is funny, and the bobble head joke you made in the comments here actually made me breathe air out my nose a little more quickly than usual, and I don’t really laugh at much, so that’s a big deal to me. You do a good job of moving through it in your act. So the “shit motherfucker” tic, is that a conscious choice to use those words in particular? I remember when “Tourette’s Guy” had those YouTube videos and a lot of people said that the whole “uncontrollable swearing” from people with Tourette’s is kind of a meme, and isn’t really that common of a tic. I guess what I’m asking is, are those words always the ones that you say in tics? Or does it change to other words? And did you “choose” those words? Like I said I really don’t know much about Tourette’s so I’m not trying to be rude or anything I’m just interested. I have read about it but never had to opportunity to talk to anyone who actually has it. (Edit: you don’t have to talk about it either if you don’t want to, sorry, I know that’s not really why you posted the video and I’m not trying to take away from your comedy video, I’m just genuinely interested.)

A: Surf's up, I appreciate the interest! Feel free to ask whatever. The shit motherfucker is not a conscious choice. Those people were right, it isn't very common. Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, which is called Coprolalia, and that basically translates from Greek to "feces speech" from what I understand lol. I don't always say those words, but shit, fuck, and motherfucker are definitely my most common curses. I also say asshole pretty frequently as well, but my main tics are like the bodily movements and clicking noise. Also, very recently, I've been having this new tic where I just sort of speak like gibberish German or Dutch, and it's super funny, but also not cursing (as far as I know lol).

I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy.

I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do.

A: When you have a tic or multiple in a row does it ever feel like you have to fight it? If so does it help? I sort of imagine it like having a bad dream and mentally telling yourself to snap out of it, but I know tics are just involuntary movements or noises. I had a sound I made a lot as a child that was a tic which I remember being uncomfortable, but not until I focused on it or was made aware that I was doing it. You seem like you're very aware during your performance, but when you're not in front of an audience does it just become normal at that point and more of a slight nuance or not noticable at all? Also your sun joke was also my favorite! Great performance!

A: I feel like I have to fight it when the sensation is strong and I am in a place or situation where I don't want to be having tics loudly or blatantly. The tics are like sudden bursts of the sensation that causes me to involuntarily move or make noise, and compulsions are like slower waves of the sensation. I can hold either of them, but they build up and eventually come crashing out. Good catch, it is significantly less intense when I am not on stage. I am a lot more excited and nervous when performing than when I am just hanging out otherwise. When I'm alone in my room, it's mostly just smaller compulsions, like a lot of facial twitches, with the occasional larger outburst. Thank you! That joke is also my roommate's favorite joke lol

A: \- I joined the improv team in college because a friend of mine told me to, lol. I almost didn't go to the auditions because I had homework that night, but I ended up ditching the work for the comedy. After doing improv for a while, I found out about a stand-up competition, and I gave it a shot. I bombed miserably, but I had a blast, so I've kept with it! \- I have tried marijuana for the tics, but it usually makes me far more anxious than it helps. I haven't tried specifically medical marijuana though. I have been told to try CBD oil, or a strain with less of the head high. I'll look more into Pennsylvania's laws and see what my options are there. \- Most people don't ask me anything initially, but eventually they usually do. Sometimes it does get old, but I'm usually more than willing to talk about it, since it is certainly an unusual thing that people are interested in. In this context, I opened up the floor to questions, so I'm super down to talk about it. Thanks!

Title: Tics and stims

Body: For those who may not know, stimming is self stimulating behavior. It’s most often used with Autism, but everybody has stims. Shaking your leg, tapping your fingers, twirling your hair, etc. when you’re bored or nervous. 

When I get nervous or stressed, my tics increase. But sometimes I *purposely* keep doing some of my motor tics, like bobbing my head, shaking my hands, and rubbing my fingers together, because it gets some of that nervous energy out. It’s kinda self-soothing.

Anybody else do this? I think sometimes the lines between tics, compulsions, and stims can get a bit blurry.

Q: What do you think?
A: Yeah definitely, I'll stim to get the energy out when I specifically don't want it to burst out. If I'm in public, I'll stim a lot of low key weird neck shit, shakes, or mumbling to keep from yelling. I like to think of it as going into vibrate mode lol.

Q: Why do you think that those with tourettes latch onto profanity for their ticks specifically? I've always been curious on that.
A: I have absolutely no idea! Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, but I'm not sure why there even is a cursing type. I've been using the example that it's like stubbing your toe, and curse words are the only words that make sense to use in that moment. I think that part of my brain is randomly activated.

A: As a fellow Tourette's sufferer, a lot of your tics seem a bit exaggerated. Maybe it's to make it more amusing for people, but I find it somewhat distasteful. You're promoting the false narrative that Tourette's causes you to curse uncontrollably which is not the case 99% of the time.

A: You make a great point, and I do want to make sure that people know that most people with Tourette's do not have the cursing version like I do, and also that I have it significantly worse on stage compared to my everyday life. My personal version of Tourette's does actually cause me to curse uncontrollably. It gets way worse when I am nervous, stressed, excited, anxious, or in other elevated emotional states, such as performing stand-up before a live audience. I agree that there is a false narrative around Tourette's, where people think it is always uncontrollable cursing, and I will try to inform people against that narrative.

Q: Are your tics that constant, or does being on-stage and being anxious/nervous have something to do with it? I don't know much about Tourettes, so this is an honest question.
A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.

A: That’s interesting, and makes sense, thanks for the reply. Your act is funny, and the bobble head joke you made in the comments here actually made me breathe air out my nose a little more quickly than usual, and I don’t really laugh at much, so that’s a big deal to me. You do a good job of moving through it in your act. So the “shit motherfucker” tic, is that a conscious choice to use those words in particular? I remember when “Tourette’s Guy” had those YouTube videos and a lot of people said that the whole “uncontrollable swearing” from people with Tourette’s is kind of a meme, and isn’t really that common of a tic. I guess what I’m asking is, are those words always the ones that you say in tics? Or does it change to other words? And did you “choose” those words? Like I said I really don’t know much about Tourette’s so I’m not trying to be rude or anything I’m just interested. I have read about it but never had to opportunity to talk to anyone who actually has it. (Edit: you don’t have to talk about it either if you don’t want to, sorry, I know that’s not really why you posted the video and I’m not trying to take away from your comedy video, I’m just genuinely interested.)

A: Surf's up, I appreciate the interest! Feel free to ask whatever. The shit motherfucker is not a conscious choice. Those people were right, it isn't very common. Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, which is called Coprolalia, and that basically translates from Greek to "feces speech" from what I understand lol. I don't always say those words, but shit, fuck, and motherfucker are definitely my most common curses. I also say asshole pretty frequently as well, but my main tics are like the bodily movements and clicking noise. Also, very recently, I've been having this new tic where I just sort of speak like gibberish German or Dutch, and it's super funny, but also not cursing (as far as I know lol).

A: Thank you!! Glad you checked out the other material as well. So I actually have some sort of late on-set tic disorder, I didn't get the more intense tics until I was 21. I had much milder bodily tics and some small vocal tics starting when I was 7, but the cursing and heavy movements were a late development. By the time I was 21, there were no new words to learn! (except maybe cuck? lmao, I think I've said that a few times since it entered my mind) It seems to be some sort of weird genetics, one of my relatives also got late onset tic disorder at the age of 18.

A: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?

Q: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?
A: I have way less tics when I am calm, so falling asleep is fairly normal for me! If I'm stressed out, that's probably what is keeping me awake as opposed to the tics. As for being asleep, I have had my friends monitor me while I asleep on two separate occasions. The first time I was entirely still and quiet, and the other time I apparently shook and kicked a lot, but with no clear vocal tics. So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.

Q: Did you choose that as the smoothest tick? Like were there other ones that were more abraisive, but shit motherfucker comes out smooth and friendly so you can gear your tick towards that, or reward that tic?
A: That's an interesting question, the answer is essentially that I think I did so, but sort of like subconsciously? Like, when you stub your toe, you end up yelling whatever the most accessible curse words are at that moment. I have actually literally never had "cunt" as a tic and I think it has something to do with it not having the same smooth quickness as "shit." Something to do with like the general mouth shape having to change too much maybe? In terms of rewarding a tic, and having that happen more often, I basically use the reverse method. I try very hard to hold back worse words, like the lgbt+ slur. I'm worried if I did that one too often, I'd end up basically rewarding it, and doing it more frequently. Interesting psychology, a lot to consider. It would be quite a whole feat if I were to be able to do this against any of the cursing in general. (Like how hard it is not to curse every time you stub your toe, if you stubbed your toe regularly)

Q: Hey Benny, I have a couple questions about Tourette’s that I wonder if you’d mind answering?
A: For sure!

Q: For sure!
A: Awesome, thank you, and please forgive what may seem like incredible ignorance on my end for the questions that follow. I understand that the tics and cursing are completely involuntary, and that their intensity and expression vary from person to person, like how some people bark. What I’m curious about is whether there’s a moment of conscious thought that precedes the verbal stuff. Like, does your brain think, “Shit!” and then it just comes out, or is there a complete disconnect? And on that note, do you know if there are cases where people blurt out especially pleasant things? It seems that the tics people with Tourette’s have always contain a sort of “aggressive” element, whether that’s cursing or barking or whatever. Lastly, I don’t want to write something so base and cliché as saying you’re “brave” for getting up on stage with your condition, but it really does take some serious guts to not give a fuck, to know who you are and be cool with that, to expose aspects of yourself to the world that some may find uncomfortable. You’re rad

A: No worries! For the tics, I have never once thought "Shit" and then said it, because those are pretty much always a very quick sudden burst. However, with compulsions (slower, more OCD based sensation), I will actively think "Holy fuck I really want to touch that thing over there with the heel of my foot." They are similar sensations, but the speed and intensity of it are different, where tics are like a sudden burst and compulsions are a wave. Not sure how pleasant this is, or if it is pleasant on purpose, but a British comedian named Jess Thom yells out "Biscuits." There might be an undercurrent of aggression for her as well, but I'm not sure. Thank you a ton! I really appreciate that. Right on and surf's up forever

I'm glad it wasn't distracting, I'm able to basically hold most of the tension of the tics while telling a joke, and then release it between, so I get into a sort of back & forth rhythm with it.

A: Yeah I noticed when you speak for longer then the tick afterwards is more extreme. I guess it's sort of like a sneeze? - longer you hold it in, bigger the sneeze. Best jokes for me were definitely the Radcliffe and goat ones btw. Goat one stood out from the rest and was funny af

A: Yeah definitely, I usually use the blinking comparison. Most of the time when you blink, it's just sort of automatic, but you CAN hold it. When you do hold it, you feel like you really need to blink, so then afterwards you have to blink a whole bunch. Glad you liked the goat joke so much lol, I should do a whole set of just dirty material

A: Just curious, how long could you theoretically hold it? And what exactly is the experience when you do hold it off? Like with blinking you get pain in your eyes - is their pain somewhere if you hold the ticks off?

A: That's interesting, I've actually never timed it out. When it's less active, I can go for like a fairly long time, up to an hour even, before I have a larger tic. When it's stronger though, like on stage, I could probably hold it for about a minute before bursting out. Holding feels like a very specific weird tension that's hard to describe, I suppose like having an itch, but not specifically painful and more like frustrating, if that makes sense. Agitating? You know when you have too much sugar and you get sort of agitated, I feel like it can be like that. Usually when I hold it, like on the train or something, I mostly actually just hold back the vocal tics and essentially go into vibrate mode. I'm not fully holding it back, just sort of redirecting the tics.

You know when you have too much sugar and you get sort of agitated, I feel like it can be like that. People with ADHD (myself included) often experience the same sensation when being required to sit still or suppress an urge to fidget. It's a very uncomfortable feeling of agitated tension and the longer you attempt to hold it at bay, the more it starts to consume your mental energy until thinking about or concentrating on anything else becomes almost impossible and you have to satisfy the urge. ADHD is very commonly co-morbid with tourettes, so it's perhaps not surprising that the sensations are common to both. >Usually when I hold it, like on the train or something, I mostly actually just hold back the vocal tics and essentially go into vibrate mode. I'm not fully holding it back, just sort of redirecting the tics. If I need to sit in an important meeting for a long period of time I'll find ways to surreptitiously fidget as much as possible, to curtail the need to get up and walk around, but it's never quite satisfying to that urge and the end of the meeting comes as a blessed relief.

A: Yes absolutely! Thank you for this further explanation. I actually do also have ADHD and OCD along with the Tourette's, and they all sort of manifest and blend together in interesting ways. Great examples!

A: It seems like Tourret’s is often related to saying things that you shouldn’t when you shouldn’t. It seems to often manifest as saying cuss words in public places, or making rude observations. Does it feel like your mind just is unable to hold back from saying things it shouldn’t? Or do the ticks just happen to be cussing often? I wonder what would happen if a child with Tourret’s was raised in such a way to minimize having a stigma associated with saying certain things... Awesome set! You had me laughing by myself which is saying something.

A: Thank you!! About the cursing, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called Coprolalia, which literally translates to feces speech lol. Most people with Touretet's just have milder vocal tics or body movements, and a lot of them aren't that noticeable. I think the media and TV amplifies up the version with cursing and socially unacceptable phrases because it's the most shocking. Personally, my cursing tics are almost never associated with the situation. However!!! My other ones are sometimes. I do have a clapping tic, and that one pretty much only happens either very ironically and it's rude for me to clap, or I'm genuinely suddenly happy. I also once yelled Sieg Heil at Rosh Hoshanah dinner lol. I'm not sure about the child experiment, but it's certainly interesting to note that kids in England with Tourette's will say stuff like Bollocks and Bloody Hell, according to some youtube video I watched

Q: Interesting! What happens if you try to hold it forever? Does it start to hurt or something? Or does the niggling become overwhelming? Sorry, just curious!
A: It becomes very uncomfortable and develops into an overwhelming urge that causes me to do it even more than I would have initially. It's like blinking, where you can hold your eyes open for a while, but then you feel like you really need to blink, and will probably blink a lot afterwards to compensate.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well. Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

A: I totally know what you mean, and I absolutely have tried to hold it for longer, but sometimes they just pop out of nowhere. If I am mentally holding, and it pops up, I will catch it. If I am not ready for it though, I can't manage the build. I think I have built up that specific muscle for catching the F slur for the queer community, because that is such an intense one, and so I will generally try to fight it harder than the others.

A: Definitely way more the first one! I can fight it, but it's like a pressure that builds up. Overall, it's sort of a mix between slow pressure based compulsions and very sudden bursts that are essentially automatic. The bursts are much harder to fight or predict. In the video, consider the shaking to be mostly compulsions and the sudden shouts to be bursts

Does “shit motherfucker” have a personal, or specific, appeal? Also do you ever get scared to pick your nose?

A: Great question, and for sure, there are definitely particular words that sort of scratch the itch in a very particular way, if that makes sense. A good way to relate to it is when you stub your toe, you don't go "Hello yes good day," you go "Fucking shit fuck." I think it's a similar part of the brain being activated. Some people though are able to redirect that and say other words, like when you stub your toe and try not to curse. That mental sensation (not including the pain of the toe) is sort of what it feels like when I try to hold it in, or redirect it. I'm not sure why those are my words in particular, but for some reason Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass are my main vocal tics besides the clicking noise. (maybe that's a curse in a different language? lol) As for picking my nose, I do not get scared and if anything, am too brazen! Lol, I haven't had any issues besides the usual tics there, but I can usually feel them coming ahead of time. The biggest face issue is when I am wearing glasses, I will tend to accidentally shake them off my head.

A: Thanks for the explanation! That nervous tick you express with words aloud is honestly close to how my inner monologue expresses anxiety internally! Like not having a mute switch for internal anxieties haha, talk about wearing your heart on your sleeve lol. Ever think about wearing glasses near cute girls and “accidentally” shake them off towards them ? Seems like a great opener! Follow up question if you have time: how is dating situations with having ticks when nervous? I’m laughing at the idea of being unsure about going in for a kiss and accidentally giraffe-head butting your honey (if that unfortunate incident could hold any traction).

A: Hahahaha, so dating is actually where the tics are a huge issue at first. Especially flirting, I feel like that is probably when I have the most tourette's, even worse than on stage. I actually have this tic where I punch myself in the face sometimes. Not like a hard punch, but an expected series of knuckle to cheek repetitive movements, and if I am flirting with someone, that's probably the most intrusive and even scariest one to have. Actually dating though is a lot more okay, because once someone knows I have tourette's, they aren't put off by the tics. It is very funny though, to be making out with someone and then suddenly yell MOTHERFUCKER in their face. I have accidentally punched people a few times! Never head butted anybody though, which is surprising.

I don’t know much about Tourette’s, but it seems to me as though you are fairly “in control” of your tics and your delivery is so calm and composed (which, in my opinion, works great with your material); I found it really impressive.

A: Thank you, I appreciate that!! I have definitely had to work on my anxiety. Not my fluency, I think that's been alright, but I had to work on not being as aggressive and holding the tics back by force. I now sort of hold the reigns more gently, if that makes sense, so I'm overall more relaxed. Holding it more aggressively makes me seem way more stand-off ish, with the same fluency, but sort of loosely controlling the flow has a smoother rhythm to it, and I'm calmer.

A: Thank you!! I'm glad it wasn't distracting, I'm able to basically hold most of the tension of the tics while telling a joke, and then release it between, so I get into a sort of back & forth rhythm with it.

A: Yeah I noticed when you speak for longer then the tick afterwards is more extreme. I guess it's sort of like a sneeze? - longer you hold it in, bigger the sneeze. Best jokes for me were definitely the Radcliffe and goat ones btw. Goat one stood out from the rest and was funny af

A: Yeah definitely, I usually use the blinking comparison. Most of the time when you blink, it's just sort of automatic, but you CAN hold it. When you do hold it, you feel like you really need to blink, so then afterwards you have to blink a whole bunch. Glad you liked the goat joke so much lol, I should do a whole set of just dirty material

A: Just curious, how long could you theoretically hold it? And what exactly is the experience when you do hold it off? Like with blinking you get pain in your eyes - is their pain somewhere if you hold the ticks off?

A: That's interesting, I've actually never timed it out. When it's less active, I can go for like a fairly long time, up to an hour even, before I have a larger tic. When it's stronger though, like on stage, I could probably hold it for about a minute before bursting out. Holding feels like a very specific weird tension that's hard to describe, I suppose like having an itch, but not specifically painful and more like frustrating, if that makes sense. Agitating? You know when you have too much sugar and you get sort of agitated, I feel like it can be like that. Usually when I hold it, like on the train or something, I mostly actually just hold back the vocal tics and essentially go into vibrate mode. I'm not fully holding it back, just sort of redirecting the tics.

A: What about meditation? I realize you will most likely just slip right back. But won't your ability to hold it increase overtime. Is it a wise thing to do? To try to learn to control it? Is is controlable? What if you tried to do someghing physical instead of cursing? Like punching a wall, does that help?

A: For me personally, meditation and trying to get calm is actually very helpful for controlling it! Deep breaths, or sitting and doing nothing can help relax my body and soothe the tics. I do try to have control over them, and I do have relative control. You're right on the idea there, I absolutely try to essentially refocus the tics from being large curse outbursts to be physical when I need to. For some reason though, refocusing them can make me do it more, or basically not perfectly release the tension, so I end up having to do it more. If I try very hard to have minimal tics, I basically end up shaking my wrist relentlessly lol. I'm guessing you are joking with the punching a wall part, but just to actually answer, that would specifically be a big tic that I would try to avoid! edit: spellin da word "breathes"

Look into that, and see if it lines up with what you're feeling. If it continues or gets worse, consider seeing a doctor because it may be unrelated to the Tourette's.

A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.

A: That’s interesting, and makes sense, thanks for the reply. Your act is funny, and the bobble head joke you made in the comments here actually made me breathe air out my nose a little more quickly than usual, and I don’t really laugh at much, so that’s a big deal to me. You do a good job of moving through it in your act. So the “shit motherfucker” tic, is that a conscious choice to use those words in particular? I remember when “Tourette’s Guy” had those YouTube videos and a lot of people said that the whole “uncontrollable swearing” from people with Tourette’s is kind of a meme, and isn’t really that common of a tic. I guess what I’m asking is, are those words always the ones that you say in tics? Or does it change to other words? And did you “choose” those words? Like I said I really don’t know much about Tourette’s so I’m not trying to be rude or anything I’m just interested.

A: Surf's up, I appreciate the interest! Feel free to ask whatever. The shit motherfucker is not a conscious choice. Those people were right, it isn't very common. Only like 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, which is called Coprolalia, and that basically translates from Greek to "feces speech" from what I understand lol. I don't always say those words, but shit, fuck, and motherfucker are definitely my most common curses. I also say asshole pretty frequently as well, but my main tics are like the bodily movements and clicking noise. Also, very recently, I've been having this new tic where I just sort of speak like gibberish German or Dutch, and it's super funny, but also not cursing (as far as I know lol).

I don't always say those words, but shit, fuck, and motherfucker are definitely my most common curses. I also say asshole pretty frequently as well, but my main tics are like the bodily movements and clicking noise. Also, very recently, I've been having this new tic where I just sort of speak like gibberish German or Dutch, and it's super funny, but also not cursing (as far as I know lol).
A: Thanks for the education man. Your act is good because you work the Tourette’s tics into it in a funny way, but your jokes are also funny aside from it, and not dependent on it. A lot of comics with “disabilities” kind of rely really heavy on them, which is only funny for so long. Yours is a good mix. Take care man.

A: Glad you were into it!! You take care as well

Q: Glad you were into it!! You take care as well
A: I don't really have anything to add, but I thought it was very interesting how when you were delivering your jokes (which had me in stitches trying to keep my wife from waking up) that your tics disappeared completely! It was only in between the talking (and maybe focusing?) that your tics had a chance to fire off. Is that about how it happens normally, or is it a conscious effort to try and suppress them, for lack of a better word? The mind is an amazing thing we still know so little about.

A: Thank you, glad you liked it! Hope your wife stayed asleep! It's a conscious (more like subconscious tho) effort to suppress them, I'm holding and releasing the tension of having to do the tics. I used the blinking analogy somewhere else here too, it's like blinking. Most of the time when you blink, you don't think about it, but you can hold your eyes open when you want to. When you hold your eyes open, it starts to get uncomfortable and you feel like you really want to blink, and then eventually you have to.

A: Thank you! Also lol, I appreciate that, that's a very bold compliment. I am currently single, but I haven't really found Tourette's to be any sort of real issue while dating. Most people get used to it pretty quickly, and once I get comfortable around someone, it significantly decreases.

A: When you have a tic or multiple in a row does it ever feel like you have to fight it? If so does it help? I sort of imagine it like having a bad dream and mentally telling yourself to snap out of it, but I know tics are just involuntary movements or noises. I had a sound I made a lot as a child that was a tic which I remember being uncomfortable, but not until I focused on it or was made aware that I was doing it. You seem like you're very aware during your performance, but when you're not in front of an audience does it just become normal at that point and more of a slight nuance or not noticable at all? Also your sun joke was also my favorite! Great performance!

A: I feel like I have to fight it when the sensation is strong and I am in a place or situation where I don't want to be having tics loudly or blatantly. The tics are like sudden bursts of the sensation that causes me to involuntarily move or make noise, and compulsions are like slower waves of the sensation. I can hold either of them, but they build up and eventually come crashing out. Good catch, it is significantly less intense when I am not on stage. I am a lot more excited and nervous when performing than when I am just hanging out otherwise. When I'm alone in my room, it's mostly just smaller compulsions, like a lot of facial twitches, with the occasional larger outburst. Thank you! That joke is also my roommate's favorite joke lol

A: I know very little about tourettes other than that it can be funny at times and must be really annoying to have. But as you describe it as a sensation, can you feel it coming before it actually happens?

Q: I know very little about tourettes other than that it can be funny at times and must be really annoying to have. But as you describe it as a sensation, can you feel it coming before it actually happens?
A: Yes definitely, the tics (faster sudden movements) are more like a muscle spasm or tension, and the compulsions (slower, often repetitive) are a lot more like a strong desire or itch. I don't always feel the tic sensation if I'm not looking for it tbh, and they also happen very quickly

A: So the tics are kinda like localized hiccups? What is it about Tourette's that makes you say cuss-words? I get that you feel the compulsion to make noise, but is there are particular reason it's cuss-words? For example, if you grew up thinking "apple" was a bad word, would you shout apple? Sorry if that sounds insensitive, but I just need to know more.

A: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?

Q: How do you fall asleep? Is it hard? Do you feel Tourette's while you're asleep?
A: I have way less tics when I am calm, so falling asleep is fairly normal for me! If I'm stressed out, that's probably what is keeping me awake as opposed to the tics. As for being asleep, I have had my friends monitor me while I asleep on two separate occasions. The first time I was entirely still and quiet, and the other time I apparently shook and kicked a lot, but with no clear vocal tics. So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.

A: Thank you!! It doesn't really get sore, but sometimes I pull the muscle in the back of my neck and that hurts a bunch lol. I've done that a few times on stage and had to pause for a while. The most sore I usually get is my face, I have a lot of tics where I scrunch up my eyes and nose. My tics are way worse on stage, or generally when I'm nervous/excited/stressed/anxious/etc. Doing stand-up is like an immediate shot of adrenaline, so it pretty much always makes it worse. When I wake up, I'm usually fairly relaxed, so I tend not to have many tics. I think that generally flips once I mentally start dealing with the shit I got to do at work, start talking to people, or once I have coffee lol.

Q: Have you been diagnosed? Part of the definition of TS is that it manifests itself during childhood, prior to age 18.
A: I have been officially diagnosed by neurologists. From what I understand, if you get it before 18 it is likely to go away, but if you get it from 18-21, it is likely to stay. Might need to fact check me here. Edit: I also likely had a very mild form of tourette's as a child (throat clearing, head twitch), but it was not diagnosed until it progressed at the age of 21.

Or does it catch you a little off guard and your reaction is , shit! fuck! ? Thank you for the comedy, a realy Mitch Hedberg cadence, really nice and precise!!!
A: Only like 10&#37; of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called [Coprolalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia), which literally means feces talk. Most people just do various noises or bodily movements. I think it is because of how hard hitting they are, like they are the most powerful way to get rid of the energy. It's like if you stubbed your toe, your mind prefers to curse, you know? I rarely have non-curse word Tourette's and I'm honestly not always sure if it even is, because of how regular words just blend in with conversation. Jess Thom, a British comedian with Tourette's, says "Biscuits" regularly, and it's pretty clear that hers is actually a tic. Thank you!! Mitch Hedberg is my favorite

Q: What do you think?
A: Honestly, I’d say the tick adds to the whole performance really well. It’s unique, and you don’t let it stop your roll which is really quite cool - I had a friend with Tourette’s a while back, and even though he had a hard time speaking in sentences without ticking, he always made me laugh with a well-executed joke or two; I lost contact with him a while ago, and this kinda makes me wonder how he’s been doing. Best of luck in the future, man!

A: I pretty much never tic in the words I type, but I have heard of that happening to other people with Tourette's. Drinking can actually make it worse, weirdly enough, I think it has to do with the fact I can somewhat subconsciously control it and drinking makes it harder to do that.

A: Thank you, I appreciate that! I am an aspiring comedian, I perform often in Philadelphia, probably about once a week or every other. That's an interesting question that sort of stumped me for a moment, I would say the literal tick sound does help stop the compulsions, but that is because it is a compulsion itself. It's just a shorter, stronger burst of one, so it gets rid of the energy more efficiently than shaking or tapping.

My newest one currently has been slapping my own face repeatedly lol, it's hilarious and also annoying. The one that caught me off guard the most was "faggot," when I first said it, because it's a step above my other ones in terms of aggression.

A: Only like 10&#37; of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called [Coprolalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia), which literally means feces talk. Most people just do various noises or bodily movements. I think it is because of how hard hitting they are, like they are the most powerful way to get rid of the energy. It's like if you stubbed your toe, your mind prefers to curse, you know? I rarely have non-curse word Tourette's and I'm honestly not always sure if it even is, because of how regular words just blend in with conversation. Jess Thom, a British comedian with Tourette's, says "Biscuits" regularly, and it's pretty clear that hers is actually a tic. Thank you!! Mitch Hedberg is my favorite

Q: First time I've seen Bill Watterson as inspiration for stand-up comedy, but I appreciate it and it makes a lot of sense. What is your take on Demetri Martin?
A: Watterson massively shaped my childhood, and Calvin & Hobbes is essentially many short jokes. Demetri Martin is also trying to keep the one-liners alive, and I respect that, as well as the sheer amount of work it must have taken him to make so much material. He's got some jokes that I think about occasionally, like the walrus vampire one

A: I’ve wanted to be a comedian my whole life and just started seriously writing jokes @ age 30 after like 8 years of working in Banking. How did you first get up on stage/any resources or tips for writing? Also your fucking fantastic man, Tourettes aside, your pace, delivery, and relentlessness is very Mitch hedberg. Imo there aren’t a ton of comedians I enjoy that use this format. The goat ending was superb!

A: Hell yeah dude, pursue the shit out of it! For your first time on stage, you might want to go with a friend or something, that's what I did. After that, I just sort of buckled down mentally and tried not to worry about it not going well. As for writing tips, I would honestly say check out Gary Gulman's twitter, he's putting out a tip everyday for a year and they are a fantastic resource. Thank you a ton!!

A: Do you ever intentionally swear/tick? It seems like you have this rhythm that sort of peps up the tempo and makes me more anxious for the punchline/next joke, like built-in comedic timing. I wonder how aware you are of this and if you'd be above "playing into" it by adding a pause or a voluntary string of swear words for extra withholding/comedic impact.

A: I have two questions, there both sleep related. Do the tics make it hard to fall asleep? Also, do you have tics during your sleep?

Q: I have two questions, there both sleep related. Do the tics make it hard to fall asleep? Also, do you have tics during your sleep?
A: Someone else asked this question as well, so I'ma copy pasta: I have way less tics when I am calm, so falling asleep is fairly normal for me! If I'm stressed out, that's probably what is keeping me awake as opposed to the tics. As for being asleep, I have had my friends monitor me while I asleep on two separate occasions. The first time I was entirely still and quiet, and the other time I apparently shook and kicked a lot, but with no clear vocal tics. So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.

A: My question is about tics associating with societally foul language. Why does it seem like tourettes tics are so often paired with words we deem inappropriate, rather than any random word?

Q: My question is about tics associating with societally foul language. Why does it seem like tourettes tics are so often paired with words we deem inappropriate, rather than any random word?
A: I'm not sure! Only like 10% of people with tourette's have the cursing type, but I don't know why that is even a type. I've used the stubbing your toe metaphor a few times. You know how when you stub your toe, you mostly feel like cursing? I think it's the same part of your brain that is randomly getting fired for some reason.

Q: How does performing affect your ticks? Does the adrenaline agitate them, or does the concentration help you control it a little? Or is it just no effect at all?
A: Performing makes them significantly worse. Adrenaline, nervousness, and excitement all combine to compound the tics. Concentration actually does help a lot, but I try not to hold it in while I perform, because then it gets unbearably difficult to hold after only a short while.

Q: I wonder how much he embellishes his disorder for the show
A: Slightly copy pasta from another response: I don't actively embellish. I let it happen when I am on stage, so I don't try to hold it back. The issue with holding it back would be that it would build up and then come out all at once. But, by letting it happen, I'm able to release the tension preemptively so it doesn't get even worse. I do have significantly less Tourette's when I am relaxed and not on stage in front of people telling jokes, so the nerves play a large part in amping up the tics.

Is it true that humidity makes the nervous ticks worse? Joe said some crazy stuff and almost got us in trouble a few times for saying the N word. When i say "us" its because we were out in a bar setting or leaving work through the skywalk. I forgot to mention, that was one of the curse words he said a lot.

I sort of imagine it like having a bad dream and mentally telling yourself to snap out of it, but I know tics are just involuntary movements or noises. I had a sound I made a lot as a child that was a tic which I remember being uncomfortable, but not until I focused on it or was made aware that I was doing it. You seem like you're very aware during your performance, but when you're not in front of an audience does it just become normal at that point and more of a slight nuance or not noticable at all? Also your sun joke was also my favorite! Great performance!

A: I feel like I have to fight it when the sensation is strong and I am in a place or situation where I don't want to be having tics loudly or blatantly. The tics are like sudden bursts of the sensation that causes me to involuntarily move or make noise, and compulsions are like slower waves of the sensation. I can hold either of them, but they build up and eventually come crashing out. Good catch, it is significantly less intense when I am not on stage. I am a lot more excited and nervous when performing than when I am just hanging out otherwise. When I'm alone in my room, it's mostly just smaller compulsions, like a lot of facial twitches, with the occasional larger outburst. Thank you! That joke is also my roommate's favorite joke lol

A: I know very little about tourettes other than that it can be funny at times and must be really annoying to have. But as you describe it as a sensation, can you feel it coming before it actually happens?

Q: I know very little about tourettes other than that it can be funny at times and must be really annoying to have. But as you describe it as a sensation, can you feel it coming before it actually happens?
A: Yes definitely, the tics (faster sudden movements) are more like a muscle spasm or tension, and the compulsions (slower, often repetitive) are a lot more like a strong desire or itch. I don't always feel the tic sensation if I'm not looking for it tbh, and they also happen very quickly

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm also throwing my support out there for you! I enjoyed that. I liked how the cursing sounded distant; I stupidly thought it was someone in the crowd the first couple times. I kinda wish you had a picture of the old Real Player buffering symbol glues to a stick, and just hold that up every time you get a tick that forces you to pause, but that's just my humor harkening back to looney tunes. Be careful, though. I've noticed that a lot of comedians who lean too heavily on their disability tend to not stick around real long. That Josh Blue guy (is that his name?) seemed to come and go so fast and I remember that almost every other joke somehow came back to self-deprecating humor about his disability. It got tiring, to me at least, after a while. I'm not trying to sound mean or be an armchair comedian, I'm just thinking out loud. And imagine me saying it all with a friendly smile like we met after a show. Good luck dude and keep up the good work!

Q: Were you always saying shit motha fucka? Was it something else growing up or was it developed later on?
A: From ages like 7-21, I pretty much just had a milder head twitch and occasional humming / throat noises that weren't even diagnosed as Tourette's. But then when I was 21, I started to develop the curses and the stronger body tics. While I have had the cursing tics though, it's been fairly consistently Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass, and sometimes I say a few worse words. The most intense word I say consistently is the F slur for the queer community, and I've only said the n-word a handful of times. I have never said bitch, cunt, dick, penis, general dirty stuff, or most racial slurs. I say piece of shit and asshole pretty often too.

A: Definitely being on-stage and being anxious/nervous make it a lot worse, I'm usually fairly calm just at home, doing work, or just like playing a video game. Seems like something to do with changes in emotion, or blood flow. If I get suddenly embarrassed, I'll usually have a big outburst, or if I have too much sugar or caffeine, it will be a whole big thing for a while. I did that today lol, I had an extra coffee and then was pretty much just repeatedly doing the slapping myself thing for a solid 35 minutes.

A: I guess the one thing I am always curious about is why is it swearing that is a tic (at least that is the trope)? Why not just random words?

Q: I guess the one thing I am always curious about is why is it swearing that is a tic (at least that is the trope)? Why not just random words?
A: Only like 10&#37; of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, called coprolalia, and I think the trope is swearing because that is the most jarring one. Some people do just say random words, like there is a British comedian named Jess Thom who says "Biscuits."

Q: Why do you close your eyes so much? Does it help with the ticks, or is it to help you focus?
A: A bit of both! Mostly definitely tic related, I have a strong blinking tic so if my eyes are already shut, it helps relieve some of that impulse. But then, when my eyes are shut, I can focus on just saying the jokes and where I am in my set.

A: I have never posted a comment on Reddit before, but I felt it necessary to make an account to say how great a guy Benny is. My one story of Benny that I'll never forget: At the time I had only met him twice. Once through a friend on the football team, and the other at a party, near the Spring Garden Bridge, that I barely remember (because alcohol). Maybe a week after the party, I'm walking around campus, and Benny is on the other side of the street waving his arms up and down shouting my name, with the friendliest smile. I wave back and say "how's it going Benny" or something along those lines. I don't know if I have ever seen someone so enthusiastic to see me, especially someone that (to my hazy recollection) I only spent about 10-20 minutes talking to. Anyway I thought it was awesome, and wanted to share that story. Thanks Reddit.

A: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: Yeah I guess Tourette's must be terribly frustrating. You have ticks when you are anxious, and ticking makes you anxious, what a viscous cycle, compounded by having had a childhood with kids who no doubt don't understand and probably being naturally unsocial because of it to begin adulthood with. You mentioned elsewhere trying medical marijuana, I'd say go for it. Had a friend with Tourette's like 15 years ago in college and weed helped him (though wasn't a cure).

A: Well, full disclosure though, my tics were not as severe when I was younger, so I had a fairly normal childhood from that angle. I had milder tics starting when I was like 7 or so, but they were just like simple head twitches and humming, and I wasn't even diagnosed with Tourette's then. Around when I was 21 is when I started to develop the cursing tics and stronger body movements. As for the medical marijuana, I think that's definitely a next step! I'm thinking of getting more into CBD oil to start, just because the medical license off the bat is like 200 dollars. I've tried a few of the CBD gummies and stuff, but I don't think their dose was high enough to really make a difference. Glad the weed helped your friend though!!

A: I didn't know it can develop late in life. Any idea what causes that?

Q: I didn't know it can develop late in life. Any idea what causes that?
A: In my case, it seems like there's a solid chance of it being unusual genetics, since my cousin also developed tourette's at the age of 17/18. Generally, when it shows up this late, it's technically considered Adult Onset Tic Disorder. For a while, I thought it may have been drug induced in some fashion by psychedelics, but that was entirely speculation, and seems less likely now that my cousin has TS as well.

I'm glad it wasn't distracting, I'm able to basically hold most of the tension of the tics while telling a joke, and then release it between, so I get into a sort of back & forth rhythm with it. There's a few specific like tic types that I have very often, so I end up doing a lot of the same or similar riffs

A: Yeah I noticed when you speak for longer then the tick afterwards is more extreme. I guess it's sort of like a sneeze? - longer you hold it in, bigger the sneeze. Best jokes for me were definitely the Radcliffe and goat ones btw. Goat one stood out from the rest and was funny af

A: Yeah definitely, I usually use the blinking comparison. Most of the time when you blink, it's just sort of automatic, but you CAN hold it. When you do hold it, you feel like you really need to blink, so then afterwards you have to blink a whole bunch. Glad you liked the goat joke so much lol, I should do a whole set of just dirty material

Q: Do you have delay your ticks a little as you finish jokes? How does that feel?
A: Oh weird, I definitely don't delay them after a joke, but I do mentally stop holding them back. There must be some delay between me letting go and them manifesting. The physical sensation of a tic is sort of a muscle tensing, or mental ebb and flow of tension that builds up. Depends on the tic, because some of them are very quick, and others I can sort of feel coming because the tension is weaker and has to build.

Q: Good show, keep on writing man. My question, how do you get such a close shave with that tick without cutting yourself? Sweet mustache.
A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold. Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol. The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well. Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

A: How often did you tic a day before your parents decided to seek a diagnosis? I've noticed recently my son has started to tic, but only 2-3 times a day. It is always random and it's always in a set pattern. I don't want to overreact by rushing him to the doctor's, but also don't want to be dismissive either.

A: We literally never went when I was a kid, we just assumed it was a nervous tic as opposed to Tourette's. I didn't finally go to the doctor until I started having full body shakes and head jerks, at the ripe old age of 21 edit: I would say no need to rush! See if it gets significantly in the way first

A: Somewhere else in this thread you mentioned you'd love to tour around with your set a little more. Would you tour with your 10-15 opening for other comedians? Or keep building a longer set and try headlining for a small tour? Would it be financially do-able at this point in your career? If you dont mind, i'm curious how much money you can make per set? I've been a fan of yours since your last video, and am curious as to what you feel needs to happen to grow your career! Thanks!

A: I would absolutely do so, the trouble is that I would need a touring headliner comedian to ask me to do that for them. I don't think it would be financially viable to try to headline currently, since I'm not sure I have enough exposure to get people to come out, but hopefully that wouldn't be too far down the road. The amount of money per set really depends on a ton of factors, including tickets sold, venue size, name, location, etc. I think my main path currently would hopefully be for online exposure to help get me work writing for TV, which would be a way to do comedy for a living, while working on stand-up on the side. That's very supportive of you to ask that by the way, thank you!

Q: Do you ever fake ticks during a set? Sometimes they seem intentional and funny but I didn't want to laugh if it was a legitimate tick.
A: Nope! I get this question a lot actually, which makes sense. I absolutely let them happen though, like I don't hold them back between jokes, but I definitely never purposefully tic during a set. I think that's why it looks fake, because it's a clear pattern of me holding it during a joke, me ticcing, hold, tic, hold, etc. I have faked them in class before though! I was the only student who was allowed to get away with just yelling MOTHERFUCKER, so once in a while I would do it just for fun lol
