Q: Honestly, I’d say the tick adds to the whole performance really well. It’s unique, and you don’t let it stop your roll which is really quite cool - I had a friend with Tourette’s a while back, and even though he had a hard time speaking in sentences without ticking, he always made me laugh with a well-executed joke or two; I lost contact with him a while ago, and this kinda makes me wonder how he’s been doing. Best of luck in the future, man!
A: That's very kind, thank you!! Reach out to him, maybe he's me

Q: [There was a study about cursing and pain](https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-of-why-swearing-physically-reduces-pain/) that basically showed cursing allowed for a higher pain tolerance.  I've wondered if that would extrapolate to tics, where using curses would effectively allow for a stronger release of the "tic energy" (for lack of a better term).  I know after I have a tic, I can internally feel a slight internal relaxing of my mind and body.  If I hold for longer, the release sensation is a little stronger, etc., so maybe that's part of the relation?

Great set btw, that's original stuff you should be proud of.  Also, I'm glad you didn't make TS the focus of the jokes, I think you'll do way better keeping your style as it is.  I've seen comics that focus everything on an oddity about them, and that gets old quick.  What you did incorporating TS in a handful of lines and improv lines was a perfect mix!
A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol.  


This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?

Tend to curse a lot? 

So are there people with Tourette’s that say nice things instead of cursing ?
A: Nobody knows why! Only like 10% of people with tourette's have the cursing type. A lot of other people either say other things, have mostly body tics, or have various other vocal tics like barking.

There's a famous british comedian named Jess Thom who has tourette's where she says "Biscuits"

Q: This may seem like a stupid question but, and please forgive me of I sound too ignorant, have you ever tried holding the ticks for longer and longer? Almost like training a muscle?
A: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball

Q: Yes!!! Exactly. It sort of builds up while I hold it, and then I let it go in between jokes. Tics are stored in the Right Eyeball
A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to

I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well.

Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold.

Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol.

The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

Q: Will you go to church with me? It would be a story of a lifetime for both of us.
A: Nope! I get this question a lot actually, which makes sense. I absolutely let them happen though, like I don't hold them back between jokes, but I definitely never purposefully tic during a set. I think that's why it looks fake, because it's a clear pattern of me holding it during a joke, me ticcing, hold, tic, hold, etc.

I have faked them in class before though! I was the only student who was allowed to get away with just yelling MOTHERFUCKER, so once in a while I would do it just for fun lol

Q: Yeah, hmm, that brings up a related question. When you formulate a thought and communicate it but there is noise due to the tics, is your recollection of it maybe slightly distorted or blurry because of the tics that happened or perhaps that your mind masks over them? 

We have this base proprioception of how our bodies feel, move, interact, etc. I imagine that there is something similar in how we perceive our own thoughts and communication. I find it all fascinating.

Regardless, great work man.

As for being asleep, I have had my friends monitor me while I asleep on two separate occasions. The first time I was entirely still and quiet, and the other time I apparently shook and kicked a lot, but with no clear vocal tics. So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.

So it's hard to tell if that was Tourette's, but I don't think I have it much in my sleep.

Q: I have way less tics when I am calm, so falling asleep is fairly normal for me! If I'm stressed out, that's probably what is keeping me awake as opposed to the tics.

Q: It is fascinating. Keep up your good attitude man.
A: I have no idea! I have used this comparison a few times: you know how when you stub your toe, you can only get out the feeling with swear words? It's like that part of my brain is randomly firing.

I think if those words were not considered swear words, I would not say them. Like, "merde" is shit in French. I never say that, but I'm sure french people with Tourette's do, if that makes sense

A: > The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to

I had a feeling that was happening in the video as well.

Right after a tic when you'd go into the next joke you looked "normal". But if you stayed talking for a couple seconds your right eye would squint as if you are holding a tic back so you could release it when the joke was told.

A: Thank you!! Great question, the answer is two-fold.

Basically, I have way fewer tics when I'm relatively calm, and shaving is not really an anxiety inducing situation. Sometimes I have a much harder time getting a haircut, because that's a social situation and the tics flare up. When the tics flare up then too, it can be awkward, and so then I'll have more tics in a vicious cycle lol.

The other answer is that I can also hold the tics in for short periods of time if I need to, so I'm usually able to wait until I've pulled the razor away, or more commonly, until the barber is not actively cutting my hair.

Q: How often did you tic a day before your parents decided to seek a diagnosis?  I've noticed recently my son has started to tic, but only 2-3 times a day.  It is always random and it's always in a set pattern.  I don't want to overreact by rushing him to the doctor's, but also don't want to be dismissive either.

Q: Why wouldn't that have been diagnosed as Tourette's?  

And is development like this normal?
A: From ages like 7-21, I pretty much just had a milder head twitch and occasional humming / throat noises that weren't even diagnosed as Tourette's. But then when I was 21, I started to develop the curses and the stronger body tics.

While I have had the cursing tics though, it's been fairly consistently Shit, Fuck, Motherfucker, and Ass, and sometimes I say a few worse words. The most intense word I say consistently is the F slur for the queer community, and I've only said the n-word a handful of times.

I have never said bitch, cunt, dick, penis, general dirty stuff, or most racial slurs.

I say piece of shit and asshole pretty often too.

Q: That makes sense, I guess I already knew that most good comedians keep it relatable, I just never really thought about it.  

One other question, if you don't mind. How much material would you recommend preparing for an open mic? I'd be real embarrased if I only had 5 minutes and they expected 15, or if I went too long, you know?
A: For sure! I think I try to work with what people know already. That's the trouble with doing situation stuff, or "you had to be there" stuff on stage, people just don't know what you are talking about, or it takes too long to build the world. I focus on writing about topics that I think the average person would immediately recognize.  


Edit: beyond that for writing, I would say check out Gary Gulman's tip series on twitter!

Q: These jokes are so good! Some of them didn't get a great crowd reaction but they had me cackling (the pb allergy one LOL). I swear whenever I see some unknown comedian, they're almost always hilarious. This one's no exception! 

I don't know how the biggest comedians these days have such huge followings but it feels like they don't actually have funny jokes (Rogan, Schaub, Brad Williams, Kriescher, Santino).  Like yeah Santino and Kriescher are pretty funny on podcasts but even with them the stand up isn't there for me. Its almost like the LA "comedy elite" is just a circlejerk of status that doesn't actually care about whether or not you have good jokes. I'd much rather watch something like this that's actually funny.

A: I just looked up shows but sadly you are no where near me. I think next summer I will make a field trip with my girlfriend to Philly just to go to a show. She doesn't speak English perfectly (as she is German) but I think she would appreciate it.

The problem is that she is going to get really mad at me if you shave the mustache and are less funny, so I guess it will be my job to keep surf culture alive for at least another year.

Q: Last year, I was diagnosed with a tic disorder that showed up as a co-morbid disorder to ADHD, so I know the struggle with the motor tic part all too well. Do you find that if you suppress the tics that it leads to some anxiety and then they flare up later? I often worry about what people will think of me if I tic in class or in public, so I tend to suppress it and then it gets worse later. It’s pretty inspiring to see you take it in stride like that.
A: Yeah absolutely, I feel like if I decide to hold it, whatever I hold back will be released stronger than if I had just let it go initially. I think that's like how when people hold their eyes open, they feel like they need to blink, and then when they finally do they blink a shit ton

Q: I’ve wanted to be a comedian my whole life and just started seriously writing jokes @ age 30 after like 8 years of working in Banking. How did you first get up on stage/any resources or tips for writing? Also your fucking fantastic man, Tourettes aside, your pace, delivery, and relentlessness is very Mitch hedberg.

Q: Buffering is great, “Like streaming a special that won’t load/that’s always buffering.” That’s funny. You’re on to something there. 

I don’t think you need to address it at all if you don’t want to. Just the straight fact that you have Tourette’s at the beginning of your set so the audience is aware and then straight into the material I think would be fine. I don’t know why I’m offering all of this unsolicited advice. You know what to do better than me, that’s for sure. 

It was just an idea since you seem to call it out once in a while when you have a tick. Just another throwaway reference. Sorry to bother you.
A: I know what you mean! I'll see if I can work on some material about the amount of time the tics take up. The only one I have currently is that I'm "Buffering"

Q: I know what you mean! I'll see if I can work on some material about the amount of time the tics take up. The only one I have currently is that I'm "Buffering"
A: This is not meant as an insult, I just noticed you do some self deprecating jokes and I have a one liner that I think could work as a non sequitur in the middle of your set, “The best part about being a comedian with Tourette’s is I only have to write half the material.” Or “...I only have to write half a set.” Something along those lines.

Q: > You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit?

Yes, but I trained myself to say fiddlesticks.
A: I'm not entirely sure, but I do have a way to relate the reason I think it is cursing. You know how when you stub your toe, you really want to curse and you flail around a bit? I think it's like that, and for some reason, that part of my brain fires off somewhat randomly. Not the pain, just the cursing and moving. Those words in particular, out of other curse words, I have no clue lol.  


This is just for my tourette's though, something like only 10% of people with Tourette's have the cursing type, and I'm not even sure they would all agree with this idea.

A: I don’t know if you know the answer, but do you know why or how the words said during a tic come to be. For example why do you say “shit” and “motherfucker” instead of something else? Do you say other words than those two when you tic?
