Title: [TOMT] [Movie] Movie with black guy on farm

Body: A movie where a black older man lives on a farm and is forced to take care of a young (probably 8 years old) Asian girl. He is very cold at first but warms up to the girl.  He is alone on the farm with his animals including chickens and dogs and cats and when the little girl first gets there she asks the man what the dog's name is and he says it's name is Dog. There's a black truck. It probably came out in early 2000s and I think it had American in the title.

Title: What non mainstream match would you recommend to others, and vice-versa?

Body: I'd love to see the opinions of people here as to what non mainstream match, or show, you'd recommend to existing wrestling fans and why. They can already be puro, lucha, or indy fans, so the concern isn't as much a match to keep them watching or ditch the mainstream.

And just for fun let's also include mainstream matches you'd use to convince mainstream haters that WWE/TNA isn't all that bad.

For me it would have to be the Up in Smoke to FIST for the CDP in CHIKARA. Sure Cloudy vomits, but UIS make great underdogs and I think the match does the 2/3 falls stipulation really well. My other pick would have to be Drew Mcintyre vs Chris Masters from Superstars. Great back and forth match that told a story, made both men look good, and given just enough time. Great example of what CM Punk meant about Masters' release.

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car? There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

Title: It has been 5 years since my last major break up, I'm still messed up over it, anyone else with this issue?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: I don't want to be that guy, but fucking get over it. Trust me, it's what you need to hear, even though it's harsh. Just get over yourself. You've created this idyllic image of your former partner that isn't even fucking close to what they really were. If they allowed what their parents thought of you to influence their own thoughts of you, guess what? It was never gonna work. She had doubts of her own, and the thing with her parents only made her realize these doubts. If she hadn't broken up with you, you would have gotten married, and eventually divorced. That would be loads worse, now wouldn't it? You're living in a world of self-pity, screaming oh woe is me, as though you are the only person to experience heart ache. She was just a fucking girl, and apparently a shitty one. You need to realize this. Trust me, I've gone through the same thing. I was engaged to a woman I thought I was going to spend my life with, and she left me for no real reason. I hated myself for years, never going anywhere, just living the way you do. Eventually, I realized how terrible our relationship was, and I hated the person I had become. I was acting like a fucking piece of shit, and all over a fucking girl. So I pulled myself together and got over it. It's harsh, it's mean, but you know what? You need to hear it. So climb down off the cross, use the wood to build a bridge, and get over it. Sorry man, but that's all there is to it.

Title: Wreddit's Slammy Awards

Body: Before Monday's Slammy Awards, I'd love to hear Wreddit's thoughts on this past year!  Without getting too complex, I threw together some categories (but certainly are not limited to) that are up for discussion:

* Superstar of the Year

* Breakout Performer of the Year

* Heel of the Year

* Best Moment/Surprise/Pop of the Year

* Match of the Year

* Wredditor of the Year

This isn't necessarily a prediction thread for the results for Monday, more of our own discussion on who REALLY should win.

Q: What do you think?
A: * Superstar of the year : CM Punk * Breakout Performer of the Year : Cody Rhodes * Heel of the Year : Mark Henry, Mainly because he is really the only heel that acts like a genuine bad guy. * BEst Moment/Surprise/Pop of the Year : The Rock being announced as Wrestlemania Host I think got the biggest pop. * Match of the Year : CM Punk vs John Cena at MITB *Wredditor of the Year : MickFoley

Who is gonna start as champions? Who they will defend their titles against? Which hall of famer will return to the regular roster? All of them? None of them? Is 'taker going to be 20-0 in your storyline? Or 19-1? Please do tell us all the details and we will se if you can be ~~better than Vince Russo~~ a good booker!

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm going to have Ziggler start off as IC champ on Raw. Ryder as US Champ on smackdown. Punk as WWE Champ on Raw and Cena World Champ on Smackdown. I want to do a sort of midcard rising thing where Ziggler claims to have the most prestigious championship in the business because Punk has killed the value of the wwe championship to start a Ziggler/Punk feud. Then have Cody Rhodes in a stable with Daniel Bryan, Christian and Wade Barret to uprise against Cena with Rhodes leading the pack and eventually taking the title from Cena. First Wrestlemania will see Ziggler vs Punk with both championships on the line. John Cena vs Cody Rhodes(royal rumble winner) for world championship. Ryder vs. D.Bryan for US title. Barret/christian vs. Heath Slater and Justin Gabriel for the tag belts. and Taker v. HHH keeping his streak. Just me though lol

I spent years traveling the country in hopes destiny would change and I too would have my soul mate. But that time never came. "I'm sorry." I sighed as I walked to the door of the abandoned building in the farmlands of North Carolina. I took one last look behind me at the countless number of lifeless lovers piled in a corner. "It's all over, Stanford! Come out with your hands up and surrender peacefully!" Cops. Cops everywhere. All I wanted was someone to spend my life with. Someone to love. Maybe someday. Yeah, someday.

A: 25, never seen that movie. My mom spoils the dog actually(it's hers), but we are close and pretty dead on with helping me through a hardship. Every time I see her she's very clingy to me :) When I do go out, which is rarely I usually am the quiet awkward one so yeah, the people I'm with get hit on and mingle more. But it doesn't' really bother me. I'm generally counting the minutes till I get to go home and play Assassin's Creed or something.

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: I don't want to be that guy, but fucking get over it. Trust me, it's what you need to hear, even though it's harsh. Just get over yourself. You've created this idyllic image of your former partner that isn't even fucking close to what they really were. If they allowed what their parents thought of you to influence their own thoughts of you, guess what? It was never gonna work. She had doubts of her own, and the thing with her parents only made her realize these doubts. If she hadn't broken up with you, you would have gotten married, and eventually divorced. That would be loads worse, now wouldn't it? You're living in a world of self-pity, screaming oh woe is me, as though you are the only person to experience heart ache. She was just a fucking girl, and apparently a shitty one. You need to realize this. Trust me, I've gone through the same thing. I was engaged to a woman I thought I was going to spend my life with, and she left me for no real reason. I hated myself for years, never going anywhere, just living the way you do. Eventually, I realized how terrible our relationship was, and I hated the person I had become. I was acting like a fucking piece of shit, and all over a fucking girl. So I pulled myself together and got over it. It's harsh, it's mean, but you know what? You need to hear it. So climb down off the cross, use the wood to build a bridge, and get over it. Sorry man, but that's all there is to it.

A: Same here. I wish someone would have said it to me after my bad break-up. Like I said, I only say it because, hard as it might be to believe, I care about you, even though I don't know you. I've been where you are, and it kills me to know that you are going through this shit when you don't need to be.

A: Yeah, most advice I got was "Dude don't worry you's will get back together" or "dude just hit up the bar and get some slut to blow you you'll forget about her". My friends aren't the brightest.. First bad break up so didn't really know how to handle but fuck it, I'm too good for her anyway. I'd buy you a beer good man if I could.

Title: 1/2/2012 Promo Discussion Thread

Body: Today on Wikipedia, it said that the 1/2/12 promo was for Skip Sheffield returning in a "Terminator" gimmick. About 8 hours later, I checked back and the information was removed. This could mean that it was asked to be removed or it was false information. It's pretty weird. Now I' having doubts about Jericho's return.


What are your thoughts?

Q: What do you think?
A: Couldn't anyone go on there and say it was anyone? The scribbled out Chris on the notebook in the latest video was a clue I'm guessing. I'd like it to be Jericho and WWE seems to be doing pretty well with pleasing the fans as of late. The start of 2012 with the return of Jericho would be awesome.

Title: What Are Some Good Jobs For People of Low IQ (~90)?

Body: My nephew was recently, after bouts of difficulty at school and a number of issues, taken to a psychologist. Among other things, the evaluations found a low IQ.

His parents are understandably terrified as to what the future holds for him. He's not rainman: there's no particular skill or talent in his repertoire that can be enhanced upon, at least that we've found so far. He has no manual/creative skills (he's been offered a number of activities, with one-on-one training, including music, the arts, various manual skills), and doesn't pick up new ones well. Sweet, wonderful, mostly kind, and not intelligent.

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car? There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

A: Psst, surrounding "neighborhoods" they're all part of NYC :) Juniper Park is pretty awesome for the ball fields, dog run etc, in the summer, forest Park is great but it's literally -- carved out of a forest. Most people have never even heard of Middle Village, I'm curious how you ended up there, it really doesn't appeal to young people looking for social life, unfortunately. It's where people move to *get away* from city bustle and live in a more suburban style. The q54 runs down metropolitan ave to the more active parts of southern Forest Hills and Kew Gardens which would be an option if you live in the southern part of MV. There are some new bars that are supposed to be good around Ascan ave area, and quite a few good restaurants. KG has a few bars popular with airline staff, but isn't very happening honestly. Northern forest hills/Austin st is an awkward 2-bus ride away, I don't know if it's really worth it. MV is in a geographically isolated area that isn't easy to get around without a car. Again, I'm very confused how you ended up there. I kind of don't know what to tell you, Do you work in Manhattan? Check out meetup groups they are all over.

A: Seriously, how did you end up in Middle Village. Not for nothing, I took a look at your submitted and saw a picture of you and you do look like the last person to move to Middle Village. I don't mean anything bad by that just that it's a seriously residential area full of families and not much to do for young people. Also it's a trek to get to the trains. I live in Middle Village cause I was raised here and refuse to pay a broker's fee as I look to move out. I recommend Mooneys on Eliot in the summer for their patio. Bridies is for a younger crowd, but it's a lot of neighborhood kids who aren't really "open-minded." Andy's for sandwiches, Silver Barn for groceries, Framboise for pastries is my recommendation. I'm loyal to Steve's on Eliot for Pizza, but Rosas on Metro is superb. Truthfully I'd look into getting a bike/motorcycle and getting yourself out to Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Woodside for more social settings. Elmhurst is right there for food. Just realize you're in a seriously close knit community full of families. It's a great place to live and raise a family, but it's a drag if you're young and looking to meet new people and get laid.

A: Well I was living in Pennsylvania with my dad at a house we owned. Recently he got married to an old high school sweetheart who lived here in middle village. Last month he had to get heart surgery done and he got it done near here and when I came to visit I would stay at her house. He's now resting at our home in PA with my sisters and I decided to stay here to work because in PA its hard to find work especially since I had to junk my car. Nothing was in walking distance. Since my dad's wife works all the time and is barely home I find myself stuck at here being pretty bored. It's really a weird story but it happens lol. I always wondered why I rarely saw a younger crowd around lol.

Title: You book the match endings.

Body: Okay, so I want to start by saying that I usually hate the corny, terrible, match endings like Cena vs Batista last man standing where Cena taped Batista to the ring post, and won, but...yeah

Match endings to me can make or break the match.  If it's a great and super amazing match, but the ending is terrible you feel cheated, but it can also save a bad match is the ending was good.

I've had this match ending in my head for a while now, and the Royal Rumble isn't that far away:

1.  Royal Rumble starts out with say Santino and Jay Uso (this doesn't matter)

2. The 3rd persons time ticks down, and you hear "You know, I got ya, yeah--one; break the walls down" big pop from the crowd, but no Jericho.

3.  Match continues, and Big Show & Kane form an alliance (this works since they were together before the Hall of Pain hit)

4.  Kane or Show wins, and the winner celebrates, the ref calls for the bell raises his arm, confetti falls...whatever.

5.  He steps over the top rope and exits the ring like the normal big guys do, and walks up the ramp and into the back.

6.  Jericho comes out from under the ring, ref recalls decision, and Jericho is laughing and smiling pointing to his head, and is holding a smart phone with the ppv streaming (from wwe.com of course).

7. fade to black.

What are some match ending ideas that you've come up with?

Q: What do you think?
A: I'd love Jericho to return at the Rumble but I wouldn't want him to win it. Personally I don't like when a wrestler makes a return at the rumble to win. I like to see the guy build up momentum going towards it then winnning like Del Rio did. Not like Edge the year before.

Title: My boyfriend puts his friends over me, am I overreacting?

Body: He is always hanging out with/ texing his friends. Guys and girls. It makes me feel left out because he doesn't spend as much time with just me, or include me with his friends. I talked to him about it and he said he wouldn't do that anymore, but it's just kept happening...what should I do?

Q: What do you think?
A: My girlfriend actually just confronted me about the same thing. She had to threaten to break up with me if it continued because when she'd say something about it before I would say she's overreacting and it's no big deal. Only when she told me she'd leave me if it continued did I realize how big of a deal it was. The important thing was she made sure to let me know she wasn't making me choose between her and my friends but made it clear that she just wanted to be involved more which I began to do and its better now. So put some scare in him, don't make him choose. Hope it helps lol

A: I used to spend hours on those role playing chatrooms where you would "fight" people by typing out your attacks. You had a minimum word requirement and in order for you to land a hit on your opponent, you would have to describe your attack then declare that you landed your hit, before the opponent could declare he/she blocked it. I would mainly play in the DBZ rooms. Memories.

Q: http://imgur.com/XYiWIlP
A: That isn't the sway bar that's snapped. The sway bar is near the top of this photo: you can see it coming out of the top of the wheel, curving back towards the camera, then running off to the left through a small bracket + bushing. It's a rear tie rod that's snapped. See here, it's #8: http://www.newgmparts.com/parts/2000/CHEVROLET/IMPALA/?siteid=213815&vehicleid=1358030&diagram=NHP080 This should be replaced ASAP, as your wheel's gonna be out of alignment otherwise... not only will your tire start wearing away rather quickly, your car's handling could become unsafe: you could spin out much easier. You'll need an alignment once this part is replaced, too.

A: I like a mix of everything really, never really been into the sci fi thing though. Always liked movies that made me think about life or something of that matter.

Maybe a bar or something that shows basketball games. I'm into other recreational hobbies but it's not legal here :( lol. Are there any good music venues nearby? Any comedy clubs or something?

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car? There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

A: I don't have a car and honestly don't even know much about surrounding towns lol. I definitely want to check out some of the parks when it gets warmer I really like playing basketball and going for short runs.

A: Psst, surrounding "neighborhoods" they're all part of NYC :) Juniper Park is pretty awesome for the ball fields, dog run etc, in the summer, forest Park is great but it's literally -- carved out of a forest. Most people have never even heard of Middle Village, I'm curious how you ended up there, it really doesn't appeal to young people looking for social life, unfortunately. It's where people move to *get away* from city bustle and live in a more suburban style. The q54 runs down metropolitan ave to the more active parts of southern Forest Hills and Kew Gardens which would be an option if you live in the southern part of MV. There are some new bars that are supposed to be good around Ascan ave area, and quite a few good restaurants. KG has a few bars popular with airline staff, but isn't very happening honestly. Northern forest hills/Austin st is an awkward 2-bus ride away, I don't know if it's really worth it. MV is in a geographically isolated area that isn't easy to get around without a car. Again, I'm very confused how you ended up there. I kind of don't know what to tell you, Do you work in Manhattan? Check out meetup groups they are all over.

A: Oh lol. I answered how I moved up here in a reply to someone below it's a long boring story. I work only a little while away in the mall. When it gets better outside ill venture out to manhattan and other places I'm sure I can keep myself busy when it's warmer out lol

A: Ok gotcha. Definitely a weird story but hey life happens right? And you can't argue with a free/cheap place to stay, that's a fact. But most people don't even realize that there are super boring suburbanish areas of NYC. You're definitely having a unique experience... For good or ill. So if your up on the Northern side of MV, by the mall you're more oriented to Queens Boulevard than Metropolitan. You can get on the R or M and head to 71st-Continental which is the stop for Forest Hills. the Tap Room shows a ton of sports as does Austin Public. Five Burros (next door to Tap Room) also has a very lively bar but it can be super crowded! In the other direction you have Jackson Heights which is known as an Indian/Colombian neighborhood but is more and more popular with everyone. Mainly I go there for the delicious food and my sign language meetup group ;) I think you should definitely look for a sports league or volunteer opportunity just to get out and meet people. It's tough in the winter as everyone is just keeping their head down right now! Spring will come and you should look into some stuff to do.

When you go out, you're friend (who is slightly more attractive, not saying you're ugly because you're not) gets hit on alot and makes you aggrivated but you don't care because you don't like that whole "hook-up" scene.

A: 25, never seen that movie. My mom spoils the dog actually(it's hers), but we are close and pretty dead on with helping me through a hardship. Every time I see her she's very clingy to me :) When I do go out, which is rarely I usually am the quiet awkward one so yeah, the people I'm with get hit on and mingle more. But it doesn't' really bother me. I'm generally counting the minutes till I get to go home and play Assassin's Creed or something.

She then says "Wanna see something funny" and im like sure, so she shows me a picture of her naked in our bathroom. She kept laughing and went on t osay "I pretty much made your night huh" And left after paying for the gum. Will never forget.

Title: WWE Superstar of the Year Ballot

Body: **EVERYBODY READ FIRST**
-

I want this to be the most replied to post of all time. I want YOU to type in ONE, only ONE MALE AND FEMALE ~~SUPERSTAR ~~ WRESTLER from the WWE brand, that you want to be [/r/SquaredCircle](/r/SquaredCircle)'s top WWE Superstar of the Year.

Try not to vote superficially, like, for example, vote AJ out of her looks, instead of what she's done and stuff.

HERE ARE THE RULES

1. Only one vote per account. Try, out of pure honesty, not to use alt-accounts.

2. No multiple write-ins. The first Male and Female Wrestler's name you put in will be counted, any other that you list will be disregarded.

3. This thread will be CLOSED FRIDAY at 11:00 PM CST, where I will save this thread, delete it, and count each name myself. I'll put up a TOP 10 list the following day, to keep suspense and anticipation up.

4. Males and Females will be counted separately, obviously.

MODS, if you read this, can you do one of those notifications that F7U12 does above the front page, to notify everyone about this thread even after it falls of the front page, or put it in the sidebar?

Q: What's some of the advantages/disadvantages you've noticed compared to before?
A: Hmm good question since I changed it a few months ago it’s hard to say but off the top of my head I’d say the biggest advantage is being able to see more in your periphery. Big advantage being able to see more on the sides without having to turn. Disadvantages would be initially there’s kind of a fish bowl effect and you feel like you’re moving faster (even though of course you’re not). It can also lower performance but I’ve never noticed any drops on a PS4 Pro. I recommend giving it a try since usually more information usually equals better especially in first person shooters.

A: The main disadvantage is it literally makes aiming harder because everything in the middle of your screen is smaller. I play on 90 I think

A: Or a perfect storyline setup by Vince. At Hell in a Cell Alberto Del Rio will be standing in the ring waiting for John Cenas music to start playing when Vickies music plays instead. She stands at the top of the ramp and goes on to tell Del Rio that she was tricking him into thinking Cena would be his opponent so he'd be completely thrown off guard when she announces his new opponent. "You think I'm going to make you the face of the wwe just because you sweet talk me a little? Well I got news for you Del Rio, I'm taken..BY THIS MAN" Then you hear it.. "VIVA LA RASAAA" And the return is complete and Vince is a genius.

Q: What makes it popular and what’s the worst customer you’ve ever had? Along those lines, what’s the weirdest request a customer has asked for/about?
A: Popular in the sense that it is a well known chain. A funny request once was a guest had wanted a framed picture of Steve Irwin hugging an alligator on each bed. As for the worst customer experience, there has been so many bad ones it's hard to choose. We get a lot of snobby guests who expect the most luxurious of stays from an economy brand. They are the ones who come in with coupons for a 50 dollar room and will always make a big scene so other guests can hear them.

In subreddit: apexlegends

Title: $18 a skin still to much

Body: In regards to Respawn’s reply to the Iron Crown event, $18 per skin is way too much to ask. $18 is gas for a couple days to work, that’s a home cooked meal, for some that’s a pack of smokes or beer. It’s a laugh to want to spend that much to look a certain way in a video game. Granted, this isn’t the first time a label has pushed high prices on their fans. 

I could understand $5-10. That gives support to the devs/pubs and doesn’t make the fans feel guilty/torn. Also not everyone that plays this game is of age and has a job! Could you imagine, “Mom, Dad, can I have $5 to buy a skin?”, “Mom, Dad, can I have $20 to buy a skin?” Which one do you think they’d go for?

I appreciate the devs trying to right a wrong, but from the beginning it’s been to much. Sure $18 to get exactly what you want is better than $21 on 3 chances to gamble on what you want. But, is it fan friendly? I know some devs/pubs don’t GAF about fan friendly, but do you think you’d have a healthier fan base if you weren’t gouging? Don’t you think they’d earn more?

Also, yes, FTP(Free to play), you can opt out of any of this and just not pay for skins, or anything for that matter. But, shouldn’t you feel  enticed to buy, not driven away? I’ve purchased the season passes, but that’s it. The pass give you something to aim for. A set of goals for a game that really has none, other than badges.  I won’t spend $20 to look cool in a game.

Again, I appreciate Respawn’s efforts to make the situation better, they still have missed the mark in my opinion.

Edit: Think of it this way. Say you want 3 of the skins, who cares about the rest. That’s $54 you have to spend. THATS DISGUSTING! It’s literally a sick joke. As someone replied, you can buy a game for that amount with a full experience and play for months. 

Edit: For the record, I make on average $70k a year as a insulator by trade in the oil field in canada. Not including what my wife brings in. Insulting people and claiming people are broke because they don’t want to pay these prices makes you ignorant and immature.

They never really had any big history together but they're both incredibly talented and smart it would be interesting to see how they use their different skills against one another.

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm surprisingly happy for not only him but for his family that they were able to make peace with the company at the right time. I say surprisingly only because I'm not usually this upset when a wrestler passes. Warrior is the reason I started watching wrestling when I was a kid ever since my dad introduced me to it. I used to have this huge cloth poster type thing which was all black and white and had the warrior in the middle with so many cool graphics around it, it was even signed and im shamed to say it got ruined in a flood years ago. Heres to the matches warrior and savage are putting on in a better place. Shit

Q: http://imgur.com/XYiWIlP
A: That isn't the sway bar that's snapped. The sway bar is near the top of this photo: you can see it coming out of the top of the wheel, curving back towards the camera, then running off to the left through a small bracket + bushing. It's a rear tie rod that's snapped. See here, it's #8: http://www.newgmparts.com/parts/2000/CHEVROLET/IMPALA/?siteid=213815&vehicleid=1358030&diagram=NHP080 This should be replaced ASAP, as your wheel's gonna be out of alignment otherwise... not only will your tire start wearing away rather quickly, your car's handling could become unsafe: you could spin out much easier. You'll need an alignment once this part is replaced, too.

Title: [TOMT][Chatroom] Looking for People I RP'd With on AOL's Red Dragon Inn Chatroom >12 Years Ago

I read the rules and there was nothing I noticed that banned asking about people, so for awhile now I have been trying to find a particular guy/person I use to RP with in the Red Dragon Inn chatroom back when AOL was a thing that existed and had chatrooms. 

I'm still fairly close to some people I met there, but after losing internet for awhile due to crappy situations at home, I never was able to find the guy with the username Vid_gamr_Str 

I had a few cringe worthy usernames I used back then (pre-teen girl with *feelings*) but the two I used the most were icemoonhiku and DarkDragoon803 (or 903, I can't remember specifically) 

Anyway, if this is not allowed I apologize. 
If there is a better reddit/resource for this question I would love to know it. My detective skills are not super strong. 

Thanks!

Bryan will go for CM Punk's WWE championship at Wrestlemania, and win it. Alberto comes out, and loses. Bryan gets his revenge and the MITB's streak is over.

What exactly is your job at the hotel? Any "secrets" for getting a better rate? Do you have any discretion to set rates if a customer just walks in?
A: It's an economy brand which is pretty much between a local one night stand motel and a five star hotel. It's in a city surrounded by tourist cities but not a tourist spot itself. I check people in/out and help guest however I can. Most of the time if you say you have AAA they'll give you a discount anywhere without even verifying if you do. I'm told to try to read guests when they walk through the door and if I have a feeling they are local I should always up the price. I'm 100% in control of what price you get as long as it's higher than the best available rate. Sometimes I can go lower under special circumstances like if it's really late in the night or they want to stay for a week or so.

Title: What is a movie that you will not watch again, because it was too rough to sit through?

Body: I was pondering this question after sitting in my film class, and we watched the one movie I told myself I would never watch again "Requiem for a Dream", and sure enough for aspects of film editing what do we watch "Requiem for a Dream".

My reason as to why I will not watch this Aronofsky masterpiece is the last act in that movie, but more specifically what happens to Marion. The degradation of character to perform the acts she does, just to get her fix is something that will be burned in my mind forever. This does not exclude what happens to Tyrone, Harry, and Sara. But that last act is why I won't watch this movie again, seeing it for a grade yes, but just out of free time, no.

A: I've been using some kind of vasoline for men lotion my brother uses for his dry skin, and I can see some of the rash calming down and the tattoo feeling smoother so I guess alot of the scabbing is going away. It's just loosing alot of color but at this point I don't care what it looks like as long as it's healed.

Q: What do you think?
A: I was at my cousins house when we were both 12 I believe. Me and him for some reason started to light random things on fire and throw them out the window. We even had local kids across the street cheering us on so we took an empty 2 liter Pepsi bottle and sprayed a ton of perfume in it and when we lit it, flames spewed out like a flamethrower and it startled us so we chucked it out the window and seconds later the other kids ran away. We didn't think anything of it until about five minutes later out mother came running upstairs and dragged us outside because the garage was on fire. Police and firemen came an questioned us and even those kids but no one said anything. I'm sure they found all the things we set in fire and told our parents but we never spoke of it.

A: What I expected was he wasn't going to be invisible when the bomb exploded, which makes us see the explosion come out of every hole in his body because the explosion got so compressed since his body was indestructable. We'll get to see his eyeballs pop out, bleed out his ears, nose and eyesockets, and see some of his tiny inside guts pour down his ass.

Kinda depends on what you want out of the show, if you want something purely lighthearted then you might not like it. Overall, very solid show, would recommend.

In subreddit: LegionFX

Title: An email?

Body: So you'll have to bear with me for a bit, this probably belongs on r/fantheories.

1) DOFP takes place in 1962. Xavier is 22 at this point and has no kids. (Birthday July 13, 1940)

2) Based on style, the show takes place in the mid-late 1970's.

3) Amy says she needs to at least send an email to her husband to let him know she is alright. Commercial email wasn't a thing (for regular people anyway) until the mid 90's.

Lets assume that Charles gets busy with one of his lady friends immediately (Moira, Gabrielle, Amelia, doesn't matter). That means David would be born 9 months later (sometime in 1963).

If it is the late 1970s, that would mean that the oldest David could be is 16 years old. 

First off this doesn't make any sense, he had an adult relationship (where he was moved in and had prospective marriage) for a while. He ruined that relationship, moved into a psych ward, then developed another relationship. Chronologically it would make more sense for him to be in his mid 20's instead of being a teenager.

But, lets get a little more "reasonable" with our numbers. Lets assume it takes Charles a little time to cozy up to his paramour enough to have kids. That would add a reasonable 2 years. If we factor in how busy he is establishing his school we might add another year or 5. Instead of making David 16 lets put him at the more reasonable 25. Quickly we see that instead of it being the mid-late 70's we should be looking at the late 80's early 90's.

So why do I care? First off augmented reality. From an in show perspective everything is questionable. (The dog wasn't a dog, ect.) From a meta perspective, the show is constantly dropping clues that what you are looking at is not real. 

So what if the email line wasn't a slip. What if the show isn't taking place in 1979. What if instead the show is taking place in 1994, and we are simply seeing David's perception or filter of the style?

At best I give my self 60% probability this is true, but if it is I have to ask the question: Why is the period of the late 1970's significant to David?

Q: What do you think?
A: Didn't Cary mention king was in David's mind for the last 30 years? I vaguely remember that but if its true it would mean David's 30, right?

Physicists spend 50 years determining how Duncan understood the quantum mechanics to make this possible. Manu plays in a wheelchair, using paraplegic league rules to his advantage.

Title: It has been 5 years since my last major break up, I'm still messed up over it, anyone else with this issue?

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: I don't want to be that guy, but fucking get over it. Trust me, it's what you need to hear, even though it's harsh. Just get over yourself. You've created this idyllic image of your former partner that isn't even fucking close to what they really were. If they allowed what their parents thought of you to influence their own thoughts of you, guess what? It was never gonna work. She had doubts of her own, and the thing with her parents only made her realize these doubts. If she hadn't broken up with you, you would have gotten married, and eventually divorced. That would be loads worse, now wouldn't it? You're living in a world of self-pity, screaming oh woe is me, as though you are the only person to experience heart ache. She was just a fucking girl, and apparently a shitty one. You need to realize this. Trust me, I've gone through the same thing. I was engaged to a woman I thought I was going to spend my life with, and she left me for no real reason. I hated myself for years, never going anywhere, just living the way you do. Eventually, I realized how terrible our relationship was, and I hated the person I had become. I was acting like a fucking piece of shit, and all over a fucking girl. So I pulled myself together and got over it. It's harsh, it's mean, but you know what? You need to hear it. So climb down off the cross, use the wood to build a bridge, and get over it. Sorry man, but that's all there is to it.

Title: I have conducted a scientific analysis of the WWE roster, and there's only one man who can defeat Brock Lesnar and rescue the Universal Title.

Body: Fact: Brock Lesnar is an impressive physical specimen who tends to brute force his way through opponents, particularly opponents of comparable size and physical strength (Big Show, Undertaker, Kane, Braun Strowman, etc.).

Fact: Brock Lesnar's offense consists primarily of German suplexes, the F-5, vertical suplexes, overhead belly-to-belly suplexes, and occasionally running at the opponent and throwing knees into their faces repeatedly. This accounts for roughly 95% of Brock Lesnar's offense in the last 6 years.

Fact: All attempts to defeat Brock Lesnar by simply overpowering him fail. His losses in the past 6 years have either come from massive damage to the head/back on steel stairs (Cena/HHH) or when someone else is pinned in a multiman match. The last time Brock Lesnar was pinned outside that situation was as a result of a good lucha thing by Eddie Guerrero (see exhibit 1). Edit - Brock beat Goldberg at Wrestlemania, and by the laws of wrestling's transitive property, Goldberg's wins against Brock are therefore nullified.

Exhibit 1: [a good lucha thing](https://youtu.be/dkx-p_JpYyk?t=332).

Conclusion: Brock Lesnar cannot be defeated under normal circumstances except by good lucha things.

Fact: There is one man in WWE who has the desire, the *ganas*, to make a good lucha thing, god damnit woo (see exhibit 2). He wants to shock the world, and nothing would shock the world more than defeating Brock Lesnar and winning the Universal Title

Exhibit 2: [las ganas de hacer una good lucha thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe6KX3pkA70). God damn it, woo.

Fact: Kalisto's finisher is perfectly tailored toward nullifying the bulk of Brock Lesnar's offense. The German suplex is a perfect setup for the Salida del Sol, and vertical suplexes can be turned into small packages (see Exhibits 3 and 4).

Exhibit 3: Kalisto [turning being given a German suplex into a good lucha thing](http://gfycat.com/SecretBreakableCockerspaniel).

Exhibit 4: Kalisto knows what to do [against a vertical suplex](https://youtu.be/iIm2niVY8b4?t=43).

Fact: Kalisto is too short to be hit by Brock's flying knees. See exhibit 5.

Exhibit 5: Brock does his [flying knee to Braun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNzhYzCLzEE), catching Braun in the face/shoulders. Kalisto is half Braun's height. Brock would sail over his head.

Fact: Kalisto has already defeated Braun Strowman, showing he knows how to be nimble and defeat giants. See exhibit 6.

Exhibit 6: [Kalisto defeats Braun Strowman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zc8Isiqj8).

Conclusion: The only move in Brock Lensar's arsenal that might hurt Kalisto is the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, which is trivially countered into a neckbreaker by a master of lucha things. Kalisto has defeated giants and has demonstrated all the skills necessary to defeating Brock Lesnar.

He is our only hope. God damn it, woo.

Title: Would you rather fight a clone of yourself or 100 2-inch tall clones of yourself?

Body: Help me resolve this argument with my friend

The clone would be just as strong as you, it'd all be down to whoever manages to pull something sneaky first

With 100 2-inch clones of yourself, there's not much they can really do

They would be tiny in comparison to you, and could probably be dealt with by stomping around a bit

So Reddit, what would you go for? And of course, explain why

Q: What do you think?

A: It's an economy brand which is pretty much between a local one night stand motel and a five star hotel. It's in a city surrounded by tourist cities but not a tourist spot itself. I check people in/out and help guest however I can. Most of the time if you say you have AAA they'll give you a discount anywhere without even verifying if you do. I'm told to try to read guests when they walk through the door and if I have a feeling they are local I should always up the price. I'm 100% in control of what price you get as long as it's higher than the best available rate. Sometimes I can go lower under special circumstances like if it's really late in the night or they want to stay for a week or so.

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: I've heard of WAY too many people who go out of their way to tour my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania because it's the setting for "The Office" sitcom. Only problem is, Scranton is known for three things: political corruption, crippling debt, and "The Office." They didn't even *film* the show here, just the establishing shots for the intro. Needless to say, they all wasted their time (and mine by tying up traffic).

A: I'm going to assume Sheetz, the best gas stations I've ever encountered. I always have to stop by one when I'm up that way. I used to always get the fried mac & cheese but last time I was there they had done away with it...

Title: A question I never dared to ask regarding sex scenes in movies

Body: I've always been that kid living trough that awkward moment when watching a movie together with my parents and a nude woman was to be seen, or, sex was had.
The last thing I would have screamed in such a moment was "Are they doing it for real"?

I haven't seen many movies with sex scenes, neither full-on nor implied, just doesn't seem to cross my prefered genre But there are some movies where I really ask myself, there is no way they are faking it, isn't there?

Topless? Kissing? One body is hiding the other? Alright, we either cut to the "morning after" or use good camera angles, they probably don't even have to lose underwear if done right.
But there are some movies where this doesn't seem to be the case. So what happens? Shoving it somewhere else? This happens quite often in Korean cinema it seems. Camera angles that sort of imply that there is no one penetrating a bag instead.
Then there are of course movies like Brown Bunny where there is no way to fake it.

Is this an odd question to raise? Are the actors who do such thing just very open minded? Luckily not to be in a relationship? Or are there even cases where boyfriends allowed there acting girlfriends to have sex for a role?
Or are 99,999% of these cases, even the one where it really seems to be real (visibly no panties) just good acting?
What scenes are there where it is known that real penetration occured (asking it this way the whole question really sounds silly).


**tl;dr**
How many sex scenes are real?

[edit] Of course movies which are not marketed as (softcore) porn are meant.

Q: What do you think?
A: I remember thinking the same thing watching Monsters Ball where Billy Bob and Halle Berry go at it. "Do you think they're really fuckin'?" That's what I so nonchalantly blurted out infront of my ex gf at the time. I wonder why she broke up with me..lol

There was a lot of that going on in Germany back then. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notgeld#Notgeld_during_the_German_hyperinflation It's definitely a cool piece. Don't clean it if you think anyone will ever want to sell it.

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car? There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

There are some new bars that are supposed to be good around Ascan ave area, and quite a few good restaurants. KG has a few bars popular with airline staff, but isn't very happening honestly.

Again, I'm very confused how you ended up there. I kind of don't know what to tell you, Do you work in Manhattan? Check out meetup groups they are all over.

A: Seriously, how did you end up in Middle Village. Not for nothing, I took a look at your submitted and saw a picture of you and you do look like the last person to move to Middle Village. I don't mean anything bad by that just that it's a seriously residential area full of families and not much to do for young people. Also it's a trek to get to the trains. I live in Middle Village cause I was raised here and refuse to pay a broker's fee as I look to move out. I recommend Mooneys on Eliot in the summer for their patio. Bridies is for a younger crowd, but it's a lot of neighborhood kids who aren't really "open-minded." Andy's for sandwiches, Silver Barn for groceries, Framboise for pastries is my recommendation. I'm loyal to Steve's on Eliot for Pizza, but Rosas on Metro is superb. Truthfully I'd look into getting a bike/motorcycle and getting yourself out to Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Woodside for more social settings. Elmhurst is right there for food. Just realize you're in a seriously close knit community full of families. It's a great place to live and raise a family, but it's a drag if you're young and looking to meet new people and get laid.

Last month he had to get heart surgery done and he got it done near here and when I came to visit I would stay at her house. He's now resting at our home in PA with my sisters and I decided to stay here to work because in PA its hard to find work especially since I had to junk my car. Nothing was in walking distance. Since my dad's wife works all the time and is barely home I find myself stuck at here being pretty bored. It's really a weird story but it happens lol. I always wondered why I rarely saw a younger crowd around lol.

It's just the way things are, Queens currently (outside of Astoria) isn't full of stretches of places for young transplants. It's about 30bucks by yellow cab from the Village to Middle Village. Always take Williamsburg-BQE-LIE then you can pick either Maurice or Woodhave as your exit depending on which is closer to you. Q54 down Metro takes you to Williamsburg. Just realize you're not in a very youthfully vibrant neighborhood so you're going to have to go out of your way to find anything. It'll get easier once its warmer. Until then good luck and look into City jobs.

Title: What is your childhood memory that you thought was normal but realized it was traumatic later in your life?

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: At my job i have a regular costumer who visits alot. Cool older dude, we spark a joint sometimes if it isnt busy. He told me the story of the monkey. His mom would chase him and his brother saying the monkey will get them if they don't get this done. She would make them eat Castro oil and give them enemas to cleanse them. Their dad would then wear a mask, proclaiming the monkey has arrived, and catch one kid and put them in a giant potato sack and walk around outside to make them think they were being taken. He told me he thought it was normal until he got to college and told the story in a group of friends talking about old habbits their parents used to do. It was then he realized it was not normal.

Title: A Bray Wyatt face turn could be the change in direction that his character needs

Body: In my opinion the Bray character has become pretty dull and oddly predictable and I think there's a decent amount of people on the sub with a similar opinion.

I think a face turn could actually be a great change of pace for his character and give him a chance to explore different ideas and interact with the fans in news ways.

When he teamed with Roman on Raw last year(?) we got a small glimpse of what it could be like, and I remember that match being pretty awesome.

I know there will be some people that disagree, so would be interested in hearing your opinions on the matter.

A: "I just couldn't get pass it. How does someone eat everything with a spoon? Pasta, steak, everything spoon, spoon, spoon!" Chandler became erratic and plopped down on couch of Central Perk. "Steak? With a spoon? Really?" George replied with an almost disgusted look on his face. Chandler's eyes grew larger and eyebrows perched up as he grunted. "What's with this place anyway? We're sitting on furniture drinking overpriced coffee we could be doing this at my place saving a whole 'lotta money I tell ya." George chuckled through his nose. Chandler leaned forward to the edge of his seat and looked to George. "I just don't know what's wrong with me. I finally had a smoking hot girl who I actually liked and something so dumb makes me run away in a panic." "Heh, I know the feeling buddy. I'm the king of that feeling let me tell ya." Georges hopelessly tries to comfort Chandler. "Let's get outta here, too many memories of her here." Chandler and George rose from their seats and began to exit the coffee shop. "I know the best little place to get cheesecake to die for! You'll love it, it'll take ya mind right off Amber." George insisted. "Andrea." Chandler corrected him. "Ehh whatever." George replied.

Title: Does a Barrett/Regal feud sound good to anyone else?

Body: I understand that it involves pushing Regal, which, obviously, WWE isn't willing to do. However, I see some potential in it. Remember that the WWE is pushing Barrett as a "bare-knuckle champion", a very uncivilized, angry character that happens to have a British accent. Have Regal call him a disgrace to the Crown or something of the sort, and end that with Barrett wastelanding Regal through a table in the back. Obviously that sets up a few glorious matches in the ring between brawler and technician. Anyone else think this would be awesome?

Q: What do you think?
A: Barret, Orton, and Daniel are the people I want Regal to fight before he retires. At least let him have his final match be for the title or something!

Title: Gray wolves in Wyoming were being shot on sight until we forced the courts to intervene. Now Congress wants to strip these protections from wolves and we’re the lawyers fighting back. Ask us anything!

Body: Hello again from Earthjustice! You might remember our colleague Greg from his [AMA on bees and pesticides](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3l2tbr/im_an_attorney_for_the_beekeeping_industry_who/). We’re Tim Preso and Marjorie Mulhall, attorneys who fight on behalf of endangered species, including wolves. Gray wolves once roamed the United States before [decades of unregulated killing](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-wolf-that-changed-america-wolf-wars-americas-campaign-to-eradicate-the-wolf/4312/) nearly wiped out the species in the lower 48. Since wolves were reintroduced to the Northern Rockies in the mid-90s, the species has started to spread into a small part of its historic range. 

In 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) decided to remove Wyoming’s gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act and turn over wolf management to state law. This decision came despite the fact that Wyoming let hunters shoot wolves on sight across 85 percent of the state and failed to guarantee basic wolf protections in the rest. As a result, [the famous 832F wolf](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/science/earth/famous-wolf-is-killed-outside-yellowstone.html?_r=0), the collared alpha female of the Lamar Canyon pack, was among those killed after she traveled outside the bounds of Yellowstone National Park. We challenged the FWS decision in court and a judge [ruled in our favor](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2014/victory-for-wolves-in-wyoming). 

Now, politicians are trying to use backroom negotiations on government spending to reverse the court’s decision and again strip Endangered Species Act protections from wolves in Wyoming, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. This week, Congress and the White House are locked in [intense negotiations](http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/management/budget/2015/11/06/government-shutdown-could-still-lurk-budget-negotiations/75286682/) that will determine whether this [provision is included](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/259699-poison-pills-in-spending-bills-threaten-our-air-water) in the final government spending bill that will keep the lights on in 2016, due on President Obama’s desk by December 11. 

If you agree science, not politics should dictate whether wolves keep their protections, [please sign our petition to the president](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1809&_ga=1.222255199.677293821.1433786647).

Marjorie meets with Congressmen on behalf of endangered species.

Title: r/SquaredCircle, What's the worst possible match you can think of?

Body: I pose a challenge: Come up with the worst wrestling match that could ever possibly take place.  Just so we don't get too crazy, here are the ground rules:

**1. It can include any wrestlers, living or dead**

**2. It must obey the laws of physics and human conditioning (no 14 week iron man matches, John Cena clones, or fights on Mars)**

So, let's see who can channel the creative powers of Vince Russo and come up with the most horrid matchup.

Q: What do you think?
A: Scott Steiner vs Mason Ryan in a 2 out of 3 falls match. First will be a debating match where the 2 have 10 minutes each to argue why they're so genetically dominant. 2nd match, bra and panties.. If there is a 3rd it will be an all out, no holds barred one hand ties behind there backs bull rope match. Winner gets Natalyas hand in marriage.

Title: Songs about loneliness?

Body: Hey reddit, I've been listening to a lot of music lately. I really like Adam's Song, Creep, and A Better Place a Better Time. I was wondering if anyone could give me some songs about being alone. Most of the songs I find are about being lonely after a relationship has ended; however, I've never been in one, so I was wondering if there were any songs that fit my pathetic position. I don't really like hard rock too much, I'm looking for more late Green Day and late blink182 style songs. Whatever you can find, though, is fine with me. Thanks!
**TL;DR** Looking for songs about loneliness, none talking about having previous relationships

A: Shit, I moved from New York to Hazleton too (I originally lived in Ridgewood, Queens) and at a young age going from a big city to a little run-down coal mining town was a huuuge culture shock for me. The only good thing about Hazleton was being able to hop on I-80 and visit family in a two hour drive if I ever got homesick. If you end up moving to Lancaster I hope it treats you well!

Title: [EU] All that Superman did was just so he could set the stage for conquering the Earth.

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: 'He fooled us all. Every single one of us, including myself. Clark Kent. Superman. He rid the world of evil and put an end to any future catastrophic disasters to come from space. The planet was finally safe and the people of earth rejoiced. Didn't last long. He..it started big. The president was the first to go. The Kyrptonian declared his rule of planet earth with little resistance. The small amount that did resist didn't last long. He plans to reborn Krytpon and rule the galaxy as the strongest being to live and rule over the strongest planet. There was a war between heroes and villains which all ended the same. With Him hovering over a wartorn battlefield enjoying the demise of his victories. The justice league fell hard. It only took him a year to take us down. I've been sheltered for many years. I know Superman. I know his weakness. After studying him these past years I've learned a lot more. And with the risky help of an unlikely ally, I will bring order back to this world. Most importantly I will bring justice to Kal'el. I am the night. I am Batman." The caped crusader lowered the pen used to write his possible last note. He turned to his ally and nodded. "You ready?" "Ha. Ha. Ha."

Title: [WP] Over time you realize every time you go to a store the same shoppers and employees are there each and every time. You have never seen them anywhere else, and none of them seem to leave.

Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: "Hey, Carol." Ethan said as he entered the supermarket, greeting the employee who he'd see every visit. He wandered the aisles and filled a plastic hand cart with items from the shelves limited selection. "Mark, how's the wife?" Ethan chuckled as he greeted a fellow shopper turning into a different aisle. He hummed a light melody with a smile beaming from his face. "Anymore Frosted Flakes in the back, Lucy?!" Ethan shouted to the employee stocking shelves in the next aisle over. No response. After a while of browsing a near empty grocery store, Ethan stepped into the checkout line humming that same tune he had stuck in his head for weeks and bearing that same smile he so reluctantly wore. "Oh, thanks Bruce." Ethan said as he skipped ahead in line and pointed at Bruce's empty basket. "Guess you're not in a rush, huh?" He laughed and patted Bruce on the shoulder and sighed as a loud thump echoed through the store. He placed his groceries on the counter only to place them right back in after leaving a handful of change on the register. He stepped over Bruce's fallen arm and walked to the exit doors. "See you all next week!" Ethan yelled as he waved goodbye to the store full of dressed up manakins. He left the store and took in a deep breathe as he looked over at the fallen and decaying landscape mixed with rubble from demolished buildings and old cars tipped over and stripped for parts.

Title: What Are Some Good Jobs For People of Low IQ (~90)?

Body: My nephew was recently, after bouts of difficulty at school and a number of issues, taken to a psychologist. Among other things, the evaluations found a low IQ.

His parents are understandably terrified as to what the future holds for him. He's not rainman: there's no particular skill or talent in his repertoire that can be enhanced upon, at least that we've found so far. He has no manual/creative skills (he's been offered a number of activities, with one-on-one training, including music, the arts, various manual skills), and doesn't pick up new ones well. Sweet, wonderful, mostly kind, and not intelligent.

[/u/whiskeysquid] then stands to his feet and throws down numerous smoke pellets.

Body: [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: Begin living in the "now." Right at this moment do what you know is right and needs doing. Whatever that may be, do it with your entire attention. If you are washing your hands, wash them the absolute best you can, paying attention to the feel of the water, the color of the soap, the sound of the water, and the color of the towel you use to dry. Stop running scenarios about the future in your mind. Stop examining the past. Live for what is happening right now. Take care of what needs doing right now the best you are able, and the future will sort itself out in fine order. This is spelled out in a great book: "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle if you're interested.

Edit: What a blast! I've been a reader of Reddit for only a few months. Today I signed up for an account to give this a try- I thought it'd make for a nice warm-up session before I did my day's work. Well, I should've known better. I drew for about 5 hours and got tons of requests. I wish I could've drawn everyone's but hey, maybe I'll just have to do this again sometime. I just finished drawing a request for a little girl's birthday this weekend and I think that's a good note to go out on. Thanks Reddit- you guys rock.

And the Second Hokage and Kisame, they are both extremely good water justu users and I would love to see who is the better one.

What do you guys think? 

Q: What do you think?
A: Sasuke vs Kakashi would be one of my favorites. Just the history between them it would be interesting to see teacher vs student and the power of each of there sharingans go at it even though I think sasukes eyes are obviously better. Also Shikamaru vs Neji. They never really had any big history together but they're both incredibly talented and smart it would be interesting to see how they use their different skills against one another.

A: If you want to see Sasuke vs Kakashi there's a great fan animation on youtube that depicts such a fight. [I'll link it for you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZjrg4wrMWk). The action starts around 6 minutes, but the english dub isn't too bad and is probably worth a listen.

Title: What are your Wrestlemania 28 card predictions?

Body: Tickets are about to go on sale, so now is as good of a time as ever to predict what the card will look like.

I have to say this is really tough to pinpoint for me... Cena says his match with Rock will be for the WWE Championship.  Daniel Bryan says he's going to cash in his MiTB for a championship match at Wrestlemania.  The winner of the Royal Rumble gets a world title shot.  That's three title matches but only two titles.  Oh well, here goes.

- The Rock vs. John Cena
- Daniel Bryan vs. CM Punk (c) (WWE Championship) [I haven't decided which one of these guys would turn heel.]
- Randy Orton vs. Sheamus (c) (World Heavyweight Championship) [Orton would be a heel by now.]
- HHH vs. Undertaker
- Alberto del Rio vs. Big Show
- Cody Rhodes vs. Mason Ryan (Intercontinental vs. US Champion)
- The Miz, R-Truth, Christian, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger vs. Santino Marella, Zack Ryder, Alex Riley, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne (Elimination Tag... or some other kind of gimmick match.  I'd love to see MiTB back.)
- Rey Mysterio vs. Sin Cara [Face vs. face I guess.]
- Mark Henry vs. Kane
- An awful Diva's match -- Is Kharma supposed to be back yet?

That was harder than I thought -- A lack of MiTB means throwing all of the mid to uppermid carders into a random tag match.  Meh.

Q: What do you think?
A: Undertaker vs Wade Barrett--WWE Championship The Rock vs John Cena (Cena wins Chamber match causing punk to lose.Cena looses wm, becomes heel to feud with rock until mitb) -- IC title match- Cody Rhodes vs Randy Orton. (Orton winning, causing ic title to become more mainstream again) -- US Title - Ziggler vs Jack Swagger --Rey Mysterio vs Alberto Del Rio -- CM Punk vs Kevin Nash-- world championship Mark Henry vs Kane vs Daniel Bryan -- Zack Ryder, sin cara, air boom vs christian, miz, r truth, and hunico -- Just a thought lol, I think it would be cool. couldnt think of a random mid card throw in lol

Q: What's some of the advantages/disadvantages you've noticed compared to before?
A: Hmm good question since I changed it a few months ago it’s hard to say but off the top of my head I’d say the biggest advantage is being able to see more in your periphery. Big advantage being able to see more on the sides without having to turn. Disadvantages would be initially there’s kind of a fish bowl effect and you feel like you’re moving faster (even though of course you’re not). It can also lower performance but I’ve never noticed any drops on a PS4 Pro. I recommend giving it a try since usually more information usually equals better especially in first person shooters.

Title: I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year, but have a crush on a new guy.. am I terrible person?

Body: So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. Last week, though, I met this guy and I have a huge crush on him.. to the point where when he smiles at me, I swear my heart jumps a little.

The thing is, I only have a little while with this new guy until I'll most likely never see him again. (I'm on vacation).

I thought I loved my boyfriend, but I feel like if that were true, I wouldn't like this new guy.

So a few questions...

Should I tell my boyfriend?

Should I break up with him when I get home?

Am I terrible person for liking someone else?

Q: What do you think?
A: yes, you should break up with your current boyfriend in favor of a guy you probably will never see again. That is the mature thing to do.

Q: yes, you should break up with your current boyfriend in favor of a guy you probably will never see again. That is the mature thing to do.
A: No, that's not what I meant. I just meant that if I have feelings for this guy, it could happen with someone else. And that wouldn't be fair to my boyfriend..

Q: No, that's not what I meant. I just meant that if I have feelings for this guy, it could happen with someone else. And that wouldn't be fair to my boyfriend..
A: What isn't fair to your boyfriend is slutting it up on vacation and then "feeling bad" for your boyfriend and breaking up with because it is the right thing to do. Why don't you confess to him what you did and how you feel and give him the chance to break up with you? Or is it you think if you break up with your boyfriend then maybe you can "still be friends" with him because you like him so much and he is a great guy? You know what? Do what ever you want. I have no respect for twats like you anyway.

Title: Your favorite 'smart' character -vs- your favorite 'strong' character.

Body: For this battle I want you to choose your favorite character that you feel represents Brains over brawn, and pit them against your favorite character you feel represents Brawn over brains.

The scenario is this, your favorite smart character has one month,and whatever resources they could acquire in that month to plan for your favorite bloodlusted strong character to come kill them.

Who are the characters, and who wins? 

For instance: IronMan vs Bloodlusted Hulk. The answer might be Iron Man pulls out Hulk buster times one month of prep, and wins. Which is totally valid, albeit a bit boring.

Q: What do you think?
A: Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang theory) vs Smallville tv show version of Clark Kent who has one of them red rocks that make him psycho. Howard Walowitz tries building a time machine and Sheldon is the first to volunteer to use it. Turns out he accidentally built a dimensional transporter an Sheldon winds up in metropolis . Being a the comic book enthusiast he is, Sheldon immediately recognizes where he is when we stumbles upon the daily planet. As he walks in he sees on a television set in the lobby that an unknown masked assailant is terrorizing the city and he figures out who it is easily when he notices the bullets that cops shoot at him bounce right off. Sheldon is instantly intrigued and notices lex Luthor leaving the building. They talk and Sheldon tries to manipulate Lex into getting him kryptonite but Lex plays dumb and leaves, ordering one of his guards to follow Sheldon. With one month preparation Sheldon is easily able to locate some kryptonite and begin planning his onslaught against Kent. The month goes by and Sheldon locates the evil Clark robbing a bank near the end of the city limits. as Clark leaves the bank he sees Sheldon in the street wearing a suit of armor with a large kryptonite rock embedded in the middle of his chest. In the knuckles of his armored fists are small fragments of kryptonite. Sheldon has many other tricks up his sleeve knowing more about Kents weaknesses than Kent knows himself. They both run towards each other and they throw a punch at the same time. The moment their fists meet a large flash engulfs them and they both wake up in a large stadium. Looking around they see others looking at them seeming as confused as they are. Sheldon recognizes some from other comics he's read and others he noticed were animated characters who were know in human form. Magneto, sasuke uchiha(naruto), wonder woman, master chief (halo), and batman. The camera then pans up leading to an overhead view of the arena and as the camera raises higher and higher the arena gets smaller and smaller until it's revealed Howard Walowitz is watching from a wizard of oz type crystal ball with an evil grin on his face.

It will happen as I begin a gesture (jump up like I was jumproping, fistpumping with my finger to the sky) during "i maaaaaade myyyyyyyyy" and end it by pointing a sweeping motion [as soon as the chorus hits] * My gimmick is an easygoing party kid (hell i'd even job every weekn and wouldn't mind) with the highflying style of Evan Bourne and the cunning of Edge. With that gimmick, the most I could probably achieve is the US Title, in a wonderful crowd-popping underdog fluke program where everyone loves me but expects me to lose (you know, because I'm a jobber). And then I start running up and down the arena like a boy in a candy store and yell and high five the fans. the most i would hold that first reign would be 2 weeks tops, where i valiantly try to defeat the scripted winner, and end up on my knees, head low and feeling disappointed at myself after the match... and evolve my character a little bit to make myself more determined to win it back. *sigh*... a man can dream.

Q: What do you think?
A: Weirdest thing happened last night. I was playing with 2 randos and was the champion squad going into the game. Mid game it cuts to the loading screen and goes into the legend select screen with the same randos i was with. We weren't champion squad going in but when we got the jumpship there was only 7 squads in game and the circle reset so us 7 squads had the entire map to loot. Never seen or heard this happening before.

Title: A quick look into the 3's by the Rockets vs the Spurs Defense

Body: A comment in another thread got my intrigued and I dug into the stats to see how much of a difference the Rockets had in last nights game versus the regular season matchups. I know a lot of people see it as 3-1 Spurs, but it should have been 3-1 Rockets if we could have closed out games and not made mistakes. In those 4 games the Rockets were held to a really low 3 point percentage which is a killer for us. But I wanted to know how much of that was defense related from the Spurs and how much was the Rockets poor shooting. 

&nbsp;


A lot of people mentioned the wide open three last night compared to the regular season so I dug in using stats from NBA.com.

&nbsp;

From what I can tell last night is no different in terms of getting our shots off against the Spurs compared to the regular season. We just ended up hitting them which is of course the key. It does show another thing that we kept the pace of the game to our favor shooting 50 3's versus the average of 38 in the previous 4 matchups. Thought it might be interesting to see that the Rockets apparently can get open looks against the best defense in the league. 

&nbsp;

TLDR - Some stats showing that last night was not anomaly in getting wide open looks, we just didn't hit them in the season series. 

**LAST NIGHT**

Defender Distance | 3 Point Attempted | 3 Point Made | FG% | Percentage of Shots
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------
0-2 Feet (Very Tight) | 2 | 0 | 00.0% | 4.0%
2-4 Feet (Tight) | 10 | 7 | 70.0% | 20.0%
4-6 Feet (Open) | 24 | 10 | 41.7% | 48.0%
6+ Feet (Wide Open) | 14 | 5 | 35.7 % | 28.0%

**REGULAR SEASON AVERAGE**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Defender Distance | 3 Point Attempted | 3 Point Made | FG% | Percentage of Shots
---------|----------|----------|----------|----------
0-2 Feet (Very Tight) | 1 | 0 | 00.0% | 2.5%
2-4 Feet (Tight) | 7 | 1.5 | 21.4% | 18.1%
4-6 Feet (Open) | 14.3 | 4.3 | 29.8% | 36.2%

A: Yeah but would she have been able to take them all out before at least one of them were able to grab her up? I mean their trained soldiers, even with their guard down and possibly a bit buzzed I would think they'd be able to get the upper hand.

A: I think you might be over estimating the amount of training that goes into medieval conscripts. Mostly, noblemen and career soldiers were trained, but common folk who just got thrown into arms when a war broke out didn't have much. They probably just got handed a sword and told to stab people with them and that was the end of it. Arya has quite a bit of combat training including training.

A: My girlfriend actually just confronted me about the same thing. She had to threaten to break up with me if it continued because when she'd say something about it before I would say she's overreacting and it's no big deal. Only when she told me she'd leave me if it continued did I realize how big of a deal it was. The important thing was she made sure to let me know she wasn't making me choose between her and my friends but made it clear that she just wanted to be involved more which I began to do and its better now. So put some scare in him, don't make him choose. Hope it helps lol

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car? There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

A: Psst, surrounding "neighborhoods" they're all part of NYC :) Juniper Park is pretty awesome for the ball fields, dog run etc, in the summer, forest Park is great but it's literally -- carved out of a forest. Most people have never even heard of Middle Village, I'm curious how you ended up there, it really doesn't appeal to young people looking for social life, unfortunately. It's where people move to *get away* from city bustle and live in a more suburban style. The q54 runs down metropolitan ave to the more active parts of southern Forest Hills and Kew Gardens which would be an option if you live in the southern part of MV. There are some new bars that are supposed to be good around Ascan ave area, and quite a few good restaurants. KG has a few bars popular with airline staff, but isn't very happening honestly. Northern forest hills/Austin st is an awkward 2-bus ride away, I don't know if it's really worth it. MV is in a geographically isolated area that isn't easy to get around without a car. Again, I'm very confused how you ended up there. I kind of don't know what to tell you, Do you work in Manhattan? Check out meetup groups they are all over.

A: Oh lol. I answered how I moved up here in a reply to someone below it's a long boring story. I work only a little while away in the mall. When it gets better outside ill venture out to manhattan and other places I'm sure I can keep myself busy when it's warmer out lol

Title: Question regarding WWE12

Body: I didn't know where else to post this so I'm asking you Wreddit. Just wondering in WWE12 is there a way to switch titles to a different brand. I wanted to move the IC title to Raw and replace the US title with the European title. Didn't know if it was possible or not

Q: What do you think?

Title: Daily Discussion | July 25, 2019

Body: This daily thread is a place for smaller discussion and quick questions. Moderation will be more relaxed in here but remember to be nice to your fellow Legends!

Q: What do you think?
A: Played with 2 randoms in rank last night. Both wanted Wraith. When one didnt get it he started to roast the one who did about apparently paying all this money for the wraith heirloom stuff and how he had no life blah blah. The wraith turned out to be jumpmaster and dropped instantly. I broke off from the squad pretty quick and as soon as i did the wraith dropped themselves and the douche into the furthest part of the ocean. Sacrificed his Gold rp just to get his justice.

A: Later, Marks.

Q: Later, Marks.
A: I love it when he says that. It's like he recognizes the die hard fans but still mocks them, at least after having beaten down their hero. I want to see more of that Ziggler on TV.
