Q: Just happened to me. Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one
A: Weirdest thing happened last night. I was playing with 2 randos and was the champion squad going into the game. Mid game it cuts to the loading screen and goes into the legend select screen with the same randos i was with. We weren't champion squad going in but when we got the jumpship there was only 7 squads in game and the circle reset so us 7 squads had the entire map to loot. Never seen or heard this happening before.

Petition to make RPAN a permanent thing Twitch might do the same thing with IRL streams, but the magic is with RPAN that you don't have to be a famous streamer with an established personality for people to actually watch you. RPAN is raw humanity - the good, the bad, and the weird - put on display for everyone to see, and that's what makes it so unique and refreshing. I would love to see this expanded with things like subreddit specific streams and more available slots in the future.

(Showerthought) This would have been fuckin' diabolical.

Q: What I expected was he wasn't going to be invisible when the bomb exploded, which makes us see the explosion come out of every hole in his body because the explosion got so compressed since his body was indestructable.  

We'll get to see his eyeballs pop out, bleed out his ears, nose and eyesockets, and see some of his tiny inside guts pour down his ass.

Makes me feel queezy just imagining how fucked up that would have been combined with what you said
A: I thought when he exploded it would only have been his insides and he'd just be laying there, skin in tact. Kind of like when an ice cream bar melts inside the wrapper

$18 a skin still to much In regards to Respawn‚Äôs reply to the Iron Crown event, $18 per skin is way too much to ask. $18 is gas for a couple days to work, that‚Äôs a home cooked meal, for some that‚Äôs a pack of smokes or beer. It‚Äôs a laugh to want to spend that much to look a certain way in a video game. Granted, this isn‚Äôt the first time a label has pushed high prices on their fans. I could understand $5-10. That gives support to the devs/pubs and doesn‚Äôt make the fans feel guilty/torn. Also not everyone that plays this game is of age and has a job! Could you imagine, ‚ÄúMom, Dad, can I have $5 to buy a skin?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMom, Dad, can I have $20 to buy a skin?‚Äù Which one do you think they‚Äôd go for? I appreciate the devs trying to right a wrong, but from the beginning it‚Äôs been to much. Sure $18 to get exactly what you want is better than $21 on 3 chances to gamble on what you want. But, is it fan friendly? I know some devs/pubs don‚Äôt GAF about fan friendly, but do you think you‚Äôd have a healthier fan base if you weren‚Äôt gouging? Don‚Äôt you think they‚Äôd earn more? Also, yes, FTP(Free to play), you can opt out of any of this and just not pay for skins, or anything for that matter. But, shouldn‚Äôt you feel enticed to buy, not driven away? I‚Äôve purchased the season passes, but that‚Äôs it. The pass give you something to aim for. A set of goals for a game that really has none, other than badges. I won‚Äôt spend $20 to look cool in a game. Again, I appreciate Respawn‚Äôs efforts to make the situation better, they still have missed the mark in my opinion. Edit: Think of it this way. Say you want 3 of the skins, who cares about the rest. That‚Äôs $54 you have to spend. THATS DISGUSTING! It‚Äôs literally a sick joke. As someone replied, you can buy a game for that amount with a full experience and play for months. Edit: For the record, I make on average $70k a year as a insulator by trade in the oil field in canada. Not including what my wife brings in. Insulting people and claiming people are broke because they don‚Äôt want to pay these prices makes you ignorant and immature.

Q: What do you think?
A: Skins you can't even see during gameplay

When one didnt get it he started to roast the one who did about apparently paying all this money for the wraith heirloom stuff and how he had no life blah blah. The wraith turned out to be jumpmaster and dropped instantly. I broke off from the squad pretty quick and as soon as i did the wraith dropped themselves and the douche into the furthest part of the ocean. Sacrificed his Gold rp just to get his justice.

A: Hmm good question since I changed it a few months ago it‚Äôs hard to say but off the top of my head I‚Äôd say the biggest advantage is being able to see more in your periphery. Big advantage being able to see more on the sides without having to turn. Disadvantages would be initially there‚Äôs kind of a fish bowl effect and you feel like you‚Äôre moving faster (even though of course you‚Äôre not). It can also lower performance but I‚Äôve never noticed any drops on a PS4 Pro. 

I recommend giving it a try since usually more information usually equals better especially in first person shooters.

I am the biggest dumbass in the history of Ps4 ownership, and I just have to share So for the past 3 hours, I have been trying to eject my Days Gone game disk from my PS4. But nothing would ever come out. It would just beep 3 times and thats it. I looked up videos online on how to manually eject a disk with a Screwdriver. After realizing I didnt have one small enough, I go over to the nearest Home Depot to buy one. I come home, try to use the screw driver, and it doesnt fucking work. I do exactly what this video tells me to do but it didnt work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPH-hweb9jo I keep trying and trying. Tapping the PS4 occasionally, looking at other videos, shaking it out of frustaration. But then it hits me. Days Gone was something I downloaded over the PSN Store. I never had a game disc to begin with. Im going to go to bed, but I needed somebody to hear my shameful story so that at least SOMETHING comes outta this, regardless of what that is

Mid game it cuts to the loading screen and goes into the legend select screen with the same randos i was with. We weren't champion squad going in but when we got the jumpship there was only 7 squads in game and the circle reset so us 7 squads had the entire map to loot.

Petition to make RPAN a permanent thing Twitch might do the same thing with IRL streams, but the magic is with RPAN that you don't have to be a famous streamer with an established personality for people to actually watch you.

I would love to see this expanded with things like subreddit specific streams and more available slots in the future.

Q: What I expected was he wasn't going to be invisible when the bomb exploded, which makes us see the explosion come out of every hole in his body because the explosion got so compressed since his body was indestructable.  

We'll get to see his eyeballs pop out, bleed out his ears, nose and eyesockets, and see some of his tiny inside guts pour down his ass.

Makes me feel queezy just imagining how fucked up that would have been combined with what you said
A: I thought when he exploded it would only have been his insides and he'd just be laying there, skin in tact. Kind of like when an ice cream bar melts inside the wrapper

$18 a skin still to much In regards to Respawn‚Äôs reply to the Iron Crown event, $18 per skin is way too much to ask. $18 is gas for a couple days to work, that‚Äôs a home cooked meal, for some that‚Äôs a pack of smokes or beer. It‚Äôs a laugh to want to spend that much to look a certain way in a video game. Granted, this isn‚Äôt the first time a label has pushed high prices on their fans. I could understand $5-10. That gives support to the devs/pubs and doesn‚Äôt make the fans feel guilty/torn. Also not everyone that plays this game is of age and has a job! Could you imagine, ‚ÄúMom, Dad, can I have $5 to buy a skin?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMom, Dad, can I have $20 to buy a skin?‚Äù Which one do you think they‚Äôd go for? I appreciate the devs trying to right a wrong, but from the beginning it‚Äôs been to much. Sure $18 to get exactly what you want is better than $21 on 3 chances to gamble on what you want. But, is it fan friendly? I know some devs/pubs don‚Äôt GAF about fan friendly, but do you think you‚Äôd have a healthier fan base if you weren‚Äôt gouging? Don‚Äôt you think they‚Äôd earn more? Also, yes, FTP(Free to play), you can opt out of any of this and just not pay for skins, or anything for that matter. But, shouldn‚Äôt you feel enticed to buy, not driven away? I‚Äôve purchased the season passes, but that‚Äôs it. The pass give you something to aim for. A set of goals for a game that really has none, other than badges. I won‚Äôt spend $20 to look cool in a game. Again, I appreciate Respawn‚Äôs efforts to make the situation better, they still have missed the mark in my opinion. Edit: Think of it this way. Say you want 3 of the skins, who cares about the rest. That‚Äôs $54 you have to spend. THATS DISGUSTING! It‚Äôs literally a sick joke. As someone replied, you can buy a game for that amount with a full experience and play for months. Edit: For the record, I make on average $70k a year as a insulator by trade in the oil field in canada. Not including what my wife brings in. Insulting people and claiming people are broke because they don‚Äôt want to pay these prices makes you ignorant and immature.

What's your favorite part of ranked? My favorite part of ranked is getting in teams with 2 people in party chat. Love having zero communication.

Q: What do you think?
A: Being in the top 3, even top 4. I'm shit at the game but when you can make a really good play that impacts the game in a big way and even win the game, boy its hype.

How anyone uses shotguns in this game is beyond me I hate them with a passion. I'm having to get 10 kills with a PK for one of my weekly challenges and it's by far my least favorite challenge lmao.

A: Same shit with me and I'm lucky if I can even find an Lstar once every 10 games

Q: Yeah for sure, it's each to their own, but it definitely will make it a lot harder initially if you bump FOV up miles
A: Fair enough, it‚Äôs a preference thing. Once I got used to it I‚Äôve had no issues with aiming.

A: Hmm good question since I changed it a few months ago it‚Äôs hard to say but off the top of my head I‚Äôd say the biggest advantage is being able to see more in your periphery. Big advantage being able to see more on the sides without having to turn. Disadvantages would be initially there‚Äôs kind of a fish bowl effect and you feel like you‚Äôre moving faster (even though of course you‚Äôre not). It can also lower performance but I‚Äôve never noticed any drops on a PS4 Pro. 

I recommend giving it a try since usually more information usually equals better especially in first person shooters.

I am the biggest dumbass in the history of Ps4 ownership, and I just have to share So for the past 3 hours, I have been trying to eject my Days Gone game disk from my PS4. But nothing would ever come out. It would just beep 3 times and thats it. I looked up videos online on how to manually eject a disk with a Screwdriver. After realizing I didnt have one small enough, I go over to the nearest Home Depot to buy one. I come home, try to use the screw driver, and it doesnt fucking work. I do exactly what this video tells me to do but it didnt work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPH-hweb9jo I keep trying and trying. Tapping the PS4 occasionally, looking at other videos, shaking it out of frustaration. But then it hits me. Days Gone was something I downloaded over the PSN Store. I never had a game disc to begin with. Im going to go to bed, but I needed somebody to hear my shameful story so that at least SOMETHING comes outta this, regardless of what that is

What is your childhood memory that you thought was normal but realized it was traumatic later in your life?

Q: What do you think?
A: At my job i have a regular costumer who visits alot. Cool older dude, we spark a joint sometimes if it isnt busy. He told me the story of the monkey. His mom would chase him and his brother saying the monkey will get them if they don't get this done. She would make them eat Castro oil and give them enemas to cleanse them. Their dad would then wear a mask, proclaiming the monkey has arrived, and catch one kid and put them in a giant potato sack and walk around outside to make them think they were being taken. He told me he thought it was normal until he got to college and told the story in a group of friends talking about old habbits their parents used to do. It was then he realized it was not normal.

STOP ENTERING SQUAD MATCHES IF YOU DONT INTEND TO WORK AS A SQUAD. I shouldn't be banned from joining matches due to quiting before the match starts when people refuse to drop as a team. I get my ranked dropped because of other peoples idiocracy. And that's just dumb. EDIT: to all the people who are saying toxic crap that I probably suck. My top ten ratio in Squad disagrees https://imgur.com/a/3o97tIY

Q: Usually, when i play with randoms i set up rules that i follow before trusting any of them.

&#x200B;

1: Spam inviting me to drop with you without putting a mark on the map wont help you, you're just going to piss me off and make me ignore you half the time.

&#x200B;

2: If you're hotdropping when you're just 2 premades i WONT follow you, i know that you're dead as soon as you touch the earth, wont bother.

&#x200B;

3: Instead of going into popular drops, drop over places that are close to fighting points, atleast you can loot up and have agency to work with.

&#x200B;

4: If your intention is to engage a fight everytime you see someone (even if he's 500m away) instead of tracking him and flanking/following him to then kill him, i will use you as a human bait for kills.

&#x200B;

What i hate the most is when you manage to survive with 3 other people to the last circle and then they engage fights without pinging where the enemies are... like, really, if you shoot into a direction and i don't see anyone, how am i supposed to help you? Ping it, ping the last position you saw him so i can track him and take a proper cover to take him down.
A: Noob here playing on an android phone. Is there an easier way to ping enemies or just the drop down chat box?

Q: Do sex workers ever stay at your hotel, or guys check into the hotel with the intention of finding a sex worker?
A: It's an economy brand which is pretty much between a local one night stand motel and a five star hotel. It's in a city surrounded by tourist cities but not a tourist spot itself. I check people in/out and help guest however I can. Most of the time if you say you have AAA they'll give you a discount anywhere without even verifying if you do. I'm told to try to read guests when they walk through the door and if I have a feeling they are local I should always up the price. I'm 100% in control of what price you get as long as it's higher than the best available rate. Sometimes I can go lower under special circumstances like if it's really late in the night or they want to stay for a week or so.

What exactly is your job at the hotel? 

Any "secrets" for getting a better rate?  Do you have any discretion to set rates if a customer just walks in?

Q: What makes it popular and what‚Äôs the worst customer you‚Äôve ever had? Along those lines, what‚Äôs the weirdest request a customer has asked for/about?
A: Popular in the sense that it is a well known chain. A funny request once was a guest had wanted a framed picture of Steve Irwin hugging an alligator on each bed. As for the worst customer experience, there has been so many bad ones it's hard to choose. We get a lot of snobby guests who expect the most luxurious of stays from an economy brand. They are the ones who come in with coupons for a 50 dollar room and will always make a big scene so other guests can hear them.

I have conducted a scientific analysis of the WWE roster, and there's only one man who can defeat Brock Lesnar and rescue the Universal Title. Fact: Brock Lesnar is an impressive physical specimen who tends to brute force his way through opponents, particularly opponents of comparable size and physical strength (Big Show, Undertaker, Kane, Braun Strowman, etc.). Fact: Brock Lesnar's offense consists primarily of German suplexes, the F-5, vertical suplexes, overhead belly-to-belly suplexes, and occasionally running at the opponent and throwing knees into their faces repeatedly. This accounts for roughly 95% of Brock Lesnar's offense in the last 6 years. Fact: All attempts to defeat Brock Lesnar by simply overpowering him fail. His losses in the past 6 years have either come from massive damage to the head/back on steel stairs (Cena/HHH) or when someone else is pinned in a multiman match. The last time Brock Lesnar was pinned outside that situation was as a result of a good lucha thing by Eddie Guerrero (see exhibit 1). Edit - Brock beat Goldberg at Wrestlemania, and by the laws of wrestling's transitive property, Goldberg's wins against Brock are therefore nullified. Exhibit 1: [a good lucha thing](https://youtu.be/dkx-p_JpYyk?t=332). Conclusion: Brock Lesnar cannot be defeated under normal circumstances except by good lucha things. Fact: There is one man in WWE who has the desire, the *ganas*, to make a good lucha thing, god damnit woo (see exhibit 2). He wants to shock the world, and nothing would shock the world more than defeating Brock Lesnar and winning the Universal Title Exhibit 2: [las ganas de hacer una good lucha thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe6KX3pkA70). God damn it, woo. Fact: Kalisto's finisher is perfectly tailored toward nullifying the bulk of Brock Lesnar's offense. The German suplex is a perfect setup for the Salida del Sol, and vertical suplexes can be turned into small packages (see Exhibits 3 and 4). Exhibit 3: Kalisto [turning being given a German suplex into a good lucha thing](http://gfycat.com/SecretBreakableCockerspaniel). Exhibit 4: Kalisto knows what to do [against a vertical suplex](https://youtu.be/iIm2niVY8b4?t=43). Fact: Kalisto is too short to be hit by Brock's flying knees. See exhibit 5. Exhibit 5: Brock does his [flying knee to Braun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNzhYzCLzEE), catching Braun in the face/shoulders. Kalisto is half Braun's height. Brock would sail over his head. Fact: Kalisto has already defeated Braun Strowman, showing he knows how to be nimble and defeat giants. See exhibit 6. Exhibit 6: [Kalisto defeats Braun Strowman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zc8Isiqj8). Conclusion: The only move in Brock Lensar's arsenal that might hurt Kalisto is the overhead belly-to-belly suplex, which is trivially countered into a neckbreaker by a master of lucha things. Kalisto has defeated giants and has demonstrated all the skills necessary to defeating Brock Lesnar. He is our only hope. God damn it, woo.

What is the shittiest city you've visited only once and completely refuse to return?

Q: Shit, I moved from New York to Hazleton too (I originally lived in Ridgewood, Queens) and at a young age going from a big city to a little run-down coal mining town was a huuuge culture shock for me. The only good thing about Hazleton was being able to hop on I-80 and visit family in a two hour drive if I ever got homesick. If you end up moving to Lancaster I hope it treats you well!
A: I moved here from Brooklyn, NY and never thought I'd say Hazleton is actually pretty worse. Possibly moving to Lancaster soon although I get mixed reactions when asking people how it is there.

Q: I moved here from Brooklyn, NY and never thought I'd say Hazleton is actually pretty worse. Possibly moving to Lancaster soon although I get mixed reactions when asking people how it is there.
A: Moving out of Hazleton is the real bitch, never mind just living there. Between lack of jobs and ones that don't pay well enough to live beyond paycheck-to-paycheck, getting stuck there is like getting stuck in a black hole. I just moved out after years of suffering there and I couldn't be happier.

A: I've heard of WAY too many people who go out of their way to tour my hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania because it's the setting for "The Office" sitcom. Only problem is, Scranton is known for three things: political corruption, crippling debt, and "The Office." 

They didn't even *film* the show here, just the establishing shots for the intro. Needless to say, they all wasted their time (and mine by tying up traffic).

[TOMT][Game] Playstation 1 Shooting game with driveable vehicles and split screen Hey folks. Like the title says, I'm looking for a game that was on the PS1. All I can really remember is that it was a shooting game and there were maybe 4 types of vehicles you can drive. The game was military style and I think it was fairly realistic.

[EVERYTHING] Either way...she's lucky to even have a papa.

Q: I think you might be over estimating the amount of training that goes into medieval conscripts.  Mostly, noblemen and career soldiers were trained, but common folk who just got thrown into arms when a war broke out didn't have much.  They probably just got handed a sword and told to stab people with them and that was the end of it.  Arya has quite a bit of combat training including training.
A: Yeah but would she have been able to take them all out before at least one of them were able to grab her up? I mean their trained soldiers, even with their guard down and possibly a bit buzzed I would think they'd be able to get the upper hand.

A quick look into the 3's by the Rockets vs the Spurs Defense A comment in another thread got my intrigued and I dug into the stats to see how much of a difference the Rockets had in last nights game versus the regular season matchups. I know a lot of people see it as 3-1 Spurs, but it should have been 3-1 Rockets if we could have closed out games and not made mistakes. In those 4 games the Rockets were held to a really low 3 point percentage which is a killer for us. But I wanted to know how much of that was defense related from the Spurs and how much was the Rockets poor shooting. &nbsp; A lot of people mentioned the wide open three last night compared to the regular season so I dug in using stats from NBA.com. &nbsp; From what I can tell last night is no different in terms of getting our shots off against the Spurs compared to the regular season. We just ended up hitting them which is of course the key. It does show another thing that we kept the pace of the game to our favor shooting 50 3's versus the average of 38 in the previous 4 matchups. Thought it might be interesting to see that the Rockets apparently can get open looks against the best defense in the league. &nbsp; TLDR - Some stats showing that last night was not anomaly in getting wide open looks, we just didn't hit them in the season series. **LAST NIGHT** Defender Distance | 3 Point Attempted | 3 Point Made | FG% | Percentage of Shots ---------|----------|----------|----------|---------- 0-2 Feet (Very Tight) | 2 | 0 | 00.0% | 4.0% 2-4 Feet (Tight) | 10 | 7 | 70.0% | 20.0% 4-6 Feet (Open) | 24 | 10 | 41.7% | 48.0% 6+ Feet (Wide Open) | 14 | 5 | 35.7 % | 28.0% **REGULAR SEASON AVERAGE** &nbsp; &nbsp; Defender Distance | 3 Point Attempted | 3 Point Made | FG% | Percentage of Shots ---------|----------|----------|----------|---------- 0-2 Feet (Very Tight) | 1 | 0 | 00.0% | 2.5% 2-4 Feet (Tight) | 7 | 1.5 | 21.4% | 18.1% 4-6 Feet (Open) | 14.3 | 4.3 | 29.8% | 36.2% 6+ Feet (Wide Open) | 16.3 | 5.5 | 33.8 % | 42.2%

A Bray Wyatt face turn could be the change in direction that his character needs In my opinion the Bray character has become pretty dull and oddly predictable and I think there's a decent amount of people on the sub with a similar opinion. I think a face turn could actually be a great change of pace for his character and give him a chance to explore different ideas and interact with the fans in news ways. When he teamed with Roman on Raw last year(?) we got a small glimpse of what it could be like, and I remember that match being pretty awesome. I know there will be some people that disagree, so would be interested in hearing your opinions on the matter.

An email? So you'll have to bear with me for a bit, this probably belongs on r/fantheories. 1) DOFP takes place in 1962. Xavier is 22 at this point and has no kids. (Birthday July 13, 1940) 2) Based on style, the show takes place in the mid-late 1970's. 3) Amy says she needs to at least send an email to her husband to let him know she is alright. Commercial email wasn't a thing (for regular people anyway) until the mid 90's. Lets assume that Charles gets busy with one of his lady friends immediately (Moira, Gabrielle, Amelia, doesn't matter). That means David would be born 9 months later (sometime in 1963). If it is the late 1970s, that would mean that the oldest David could be is 16 years old. First off this doesn't make any sense, he had an adult relationship (where he was moved in and had prospective marriage) for a while. He ruined that relationship, moved into a psych ward, then developed another relationship. Chronologically it would make more sense for him to be in his mid 20's instead of being a teenager. But, lets get a little more "reasonable" with our numbers. Lets assume it takes Charles a little time to cozy up to his paramour enough to have kids. That would add a reasonable 2 years. If we factor in how busy he is establishing his school we might add another year or 5. Instead of making David 16 lets put him at the more reasonable 25. Quickly we see that instead of it being the mid-late 70's we should be looking at the late 80's early 90's. So why do I care? First off augmented reality. From an in show perspective everything is questionable. (The dog wasn't a dog, ect.) From a meta perspective, the show is constantly dropping clues that what you are looking at is not real. So what if the email line wasn't a slip. What if the show isn't taking place in 1979. What if instead the show is taking place in 1994, and we are simply seeing David's perception or filter of the style? At best I give my self 60% probability this is true, but if it is I have to ask the question: Why is the period of the late 1970's significant to David?

Q: What do you think?
A: Didn't Cary mention king was in David's mind for the last 30 years? I vaguely remember that but if its true it would mean David's 30, right?

Q: I haven't had a smoke since my best friend's funeral in November of 2016. I just started a new job which barely pays the rent and everyone there smokes. Just wondering if anyone has advice on how to keep off em. 
A: I'm in the middle of trying to quit. I find chewing gum or keeping mints handy are crazy helpful for cravings. I prefer the fruit tic tacs. Hope it goes well for you. Its not easy but it will feel damn satisfying once we get through the rough patch. Good luck!

[TOMT][Chatroom] Looking for People I RP'd With on AOL's Red Dragon Inn Chatroom >12 Years Ago Hey! I read the rules and there was nothing I noticed that banned asking about people, so for awhile now I have been trying to find a particular guy/person I use to RP with in the Red Dragon Inn chatroom back when AOL was a thing that existed and had chatrooms. I'm still fairly close to some people I met there, but after losing internet for awhile due to crappy situations at home, I never was able to find the guy with the username Vid_gamr_Str I had a few cringe worthy usernames I used back then (pre-teen girl with *feelings*) but the two I used the most were icemoonhiku and DarkDragoon803 (or 903, I can't remember specifically) Anyway, if this is not allowed I apologize. If there is a better reddit/resource for this question I would love to know it. My detective skills are not super strong. Thanks!

Gray wolves in Wyoming were being shot on sight until we forced the courts to intervene. Now Congress wants to strip these protections from wolves and we‚Äôre the lawyers fighting back. Ask us anything! Hello again from Earthjustice! You might remember our colleague Greg from his [AMA on bees and pesticides](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3l2tbr/im_an_attorney_for_the_beekeeping_industry_who/). We‚Äôre Tim Preso and Marjorie Mulhall, attorneys who fight on behalf of endangered species, including wolves. Gray wolves once roamed the United States before [decades of unregulated killing](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/the-wolf-that-changed-america-wolf-wars-americas-campaign-to-eradicate-the-wolf/4312/) nearly wiped out the species in the lower 48. Since wolves were reintroduced to the Northern Rockies in the mid-90s, the species has started to spread into a small part of its historic range. In 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) decided to remove Wyoming‚Äôs gray wolves from protection under the Endangered Species Act and turn over wolf management to state law. This decision came despite the fact that Wyoming let hunters shoot wolves on sight across 85 percent of the state and failed to guarantee basic wolf protections in the rest. As a result, [the famous 832F wolf](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/science/earth/famous-wolf-is-killed-outside-yellowstone.html?_r=0), the collared alpha female of the Lamar Canyon pack, was among those killed after she traveled outside the bounds of Yellowstone National Park. We challenged the FWS decision in court and a judge [ruled in our favor](http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2014/victory-for-wolves-in-wyoming). Now, politicians are trying to use backroom negotiations on government spending to reverse the court‚Äôs decision and again strip Endangered Species Act protections from wolves in Wyoming, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. This week, Congress and the White House are locked in [intense negotiations](http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/management/budget/2015/11/06/government-shutdown-could-still-lurk-budget-negotiations/75286682/) that will determine whether this [provision is included](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/259699-poison-pills-in-spending-bills-threaten-our-air-water) in the final government spending bill that will keep the lights on in 2016, due on President Obama‚Äôs desk by December 11. If you agree science, not politics should dictate whether wolves keep their protections, [please sign our petition to the president](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1809&_ga=1.222255199.677293821.1433786647). [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/fHlhKiQ.jpg) for [Tim](http://earthjustice.org/about/staff/timothy-preso). [Proof](http://i.imgur.com/3HVmXNI.jpg) for [Marjorie](http://earthjustice.org/about/staff/marjorie-mulhall). Tim is the guy in the courtroom. Marjorie meets with Congressmen on behalf of endangered species. We‚Äôll answer questions live starting at 12:30 p.m. Pacific/3:30 p.m. Eastern. Ask us anything! EDIT: We made it to the front page! Thanks for all your interest in our work reddit. We have to call it a night, but [please sign our petition to President Obama urging him to oppose Congressional moves to take wolves off the endangered species list](https://secure.earthjustice.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=1809&_ga=1.222255199.677293821.1433786647).

Q: What do you think?
A: 'He fooled us all. Every single one of us, including myself. Clark Kent. Superman. He rid the world of evil and put an end to any future catastrophic disasters to come from space. The planet was finally safe and the people of earth rejoiced. Didn't last long. He..it started big. The president was the first to go. The Kyrptonian declared his rule of planet earth with little resistance. The small amount that did resist didn't last long. He plans to reborn Krytpon and rule the galaxy as the strongest being to live and rule over the strongest planet. There was a war between heroes and villains which all ended the same. With Him hovering over a wartorn battlefield enjoying the demise of his victories. The justice league fell hard. It only took him a year to take us down. I've been sheltered for many years. I know Superman. I know his weakness. After studying him these past years I've learned a lot more. And with the risky help of an unlikely ally, I will bring order back to this world. Most importantly I will bring justice to Kal'el. I am the night. I am Batman." The caped crusader lowered the pen used to write his possible last note. He turned to his ally and nodded. "You ready?"

A: "I just couldn't get pass it. How does someone eat everything with a spoon? Pasta, steak, everything spoon, spoon, spoon!" Chandler became erratic and plopped down on couch of Central Perk.
"Steak? With a spoon? Really?" George replied with an almost disgusted look on his face. Chandler's eyes grew larger and eyebrows perched up as he grunted.
"What's with this place anyway? We're sitting on furniture drinking overpriced coffee we could be doing this at my place saving a whole 'lotta money I tell ya." George chuckled through his nose.
Chandler leaned forward to the edge of his seat and looked to George.
"I just don't know what's wrong with me. I finally had a smoking hot girl who I actually liked and something so dumb makes me run away in a panic."
"Heh, I know the feeling buddy. I'm the king of that feeling let me tell ya." Georges hopelessly tries to comfort Chandler.

Game 7: Spurs @ Clippers (5/2) Pregame Discussion Thread [Get hyped](http://gfycat.com/UnnaturalNeedyHydra)

Q: Baynes ejected for suplexing Barnes.

Bonner explodes for 20 points.

Tony and Cory swap jerseys, Joseph goes 9/9 in the paint and gets a late night booty call from Longoria.

Duncan is absent from the first quarter, found by staff floating 3" above the locker room floor in deep meditation. Takes the court at the beginning of the 2nd and does not merely dunk on Griffin, physically lifts Griffin off the floor and dunks him along with the ball through the undamaged rim. Physicists spend 50 years determining how Duncan understood the quantum mechanics to make this possible.

Manu plays in a wheelchair, using paraplegic league rules to his advantage. Refs so impressed by wheelies they let it slide.

Splitter and Green swapped bodies in Freaky Friday event. Danny is now a nasty post defender and Splitter drops 15 3-point shots. Pop finds magical way to return them to their rightful bodies with a strong message of friendship and a cameo from David Robinson.

[WP] Soul Mates exist, but not everyone has one, and everyone knows whether they do or don't. You don't.

Q: What do you think?
A: The jealousy consumed me. The anger shrouded over me like a blanket of pure rage. 
Why can't I find love? What is so wrong with me that there is not one woman on the entire planet destined to be mine forever? 
Millions of thoughts filled my head as I stood from my knees, covered in a red sea of blood from head to toe. I spent years traveling the country in hopes destiny would change and I too would have my soul mate. But that time never came. 
"I'm sorry." I sighed as I walked to the door of the abandoned building in the farmlands of North Carolina. 
I took one last look behind me at the countless number of lifeless lovers piled in a corner. 
"It's all over, Stanford! Come out with your hands up and surrender peacefully!" 
Cops. Cops everywhere. 
All I wanted was someone to spend my life with. Someone to love. 
Maybe someday. Yeah, someday.
"He's got a gun, fire!"

[WP] Over time you realize every time you go to a store the same shoppers and employees are there each and every time. You have never seen them anywhere else, and none of them seem to leave.

Q: What do you think?
A: "Hey, Carol." Ethan said as he entered the supermarket, greeting the employee who he'd see every visit. 
He wandered the aisles and filled a plastic hand cart with items from the shelves limited selection. 
"Mark, how's the wife?" Ethan chuckled as he greeted a fellow shopper turning into a different aisle. He hummed a light melody with a smile beaming from his face. 
"Anymore Frosted Flakes in the back, Lucy?!" Ethan shouted to the employee stocking shelves in the next aisle over. No response. 
After a while of browsing a near empty grocery store, Ethan stepped into the checkout line humming that same tune he had stuck in his head for weeks and bearing that same smile he so reluctantly wore.
"Oh, thanks Bruce." Ethan said as he skipped ahead in line and pointed at Bruce's empty basket. "Guess you're not in a rush, huh?" He laughed and patted Bruce on the shoulder and sighed as a loud thump echoed through the store. 
He placed his groceries on the counter only to place them right back in after leaving a handful of change on the register. He stepped over Bruce's fallen arm and walked to the exit doors. 
"See you all next week!" Ethan yelled as he waved goodbye to the store full of dressed up manakins.
He left the store and took in a deep breathe as he looked over at the fallen and decaying landscape mixed with rubble from demolished buildings and old cars tipped over and stripped for parts.

Are there small spaces to rent in Queens? For the purpose of board games video gaming I was just wondering if any of you know any places where I can rent a spot for me and my buddies to hang out at with tables and chairs that's not too expensive. Our collective homes are just too small to accommodate the amount of guests we'd like to invite :)

Q: Yes! I use to run the Gaming club in Laguardia community college. I guess it's am extension of that. We play all sorts of games!
A: Zombies you say? 

Q: Zombies you say?

I am a McDonald's employee. Crew member, mostly night shift. AMA! I'm just a simple crew member, started in Nov 2014. Just got out of high school last summer, wanted to make a little income, and here I am now. I work the fryers, the grills, and both the front counter and the drive thru. I also clean up the place. Proof, via uniform: http://i.imgur.com/ULHCLTl.jpg

Q: What do you think?
A: I used to work at a gas station third shift across the street from a mcdonalds. I would trade employees there who came to buy cigarettes on down time free smokes or something they needed or food and would even smoke me up on the side of the building (talking trees here). Anything fun like that by you?

I'm currently at work, AMA! [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: Is it possible to keep a laser gun with you while others play and secretly snipe people from your employee space? That would be fun.

Just moved to the area Hello everyone I just recently moved to Queens and got a job. For someone who has no friends here yet, what's good to do around here? On that note any chances of an organized Reddit meetup in the area?

Q: Ah that makes a hell of a lot more sense now!

So I would say get yourself a bike when it gets warmer so you can start going to the other more young focused crowds. Since you're pretty new to NYC I'm gonna guess you're gonna wanna spend time in Brooklyn. It's just the way things are, Queens currently (outside of Astoria) isn't full of stretches of places for young transplants. 

It's about 30bucks by yellow cab from the Village to Middle Village. Always take Williamsburg-BQE-LIE then you can pick either Maurice or Woodhave as your exit depending on which is closer to you. 

Q54 down Metro takes you to Williamsburg. 

Just realize you're not in a very youthfully vibrant neighborhood so you're going to have to go out of your way to find anything. It'll get easier once its warmer. Until then good luck and look into City jobs. 
A: Well I was living in Pennsylvania with my dad at a house we owned. Recently he got married to an old high school sweetheart who lived here in middle village. Last month he had to get heart surgery done and he got it done near here and when I came to visit I would stay at her house. He's now resting at our home in PA with my sisters and I decided to stay here to work because in PA its hard to find work especially since I had to junk my car. Nothing was in walking distance. Since my dad's wife works all the time and is barely home I find myself stuck at here being pretty bored. It's really a weird story but it happens lol. I always wondered why I rarely saw a younger crowd around lol.

A: Seriously, how did you end up in Middle Village. 

Not for nothing, I took a look at your submitted and saw a picture of you and you do look like the last person to move to Middle Village. I don't mean anything bad by that just that it's a seriously residential area full of families and not much to do for young people. Also it's a trek to get to the trains. 

I live in Middle Village cause I was raised here and refuse to pay a broker's fee as I look to move out. 

I recommend Mooneys on Eliot in the summer for their patio. Bridies is for a younger crowd, but it's a lot of neighborhood kids who aren't really "open-minded." 

Andy's for sandwiches, Silver Barn for groceries, Framboise for pastries is my recommendation. I'm loyal to Steve's on Eliot for Pizza, but Rosas on Metro is superb. 

Truthfully I'd look into getting a bike/motorcycle and getting yourself out to Forest Hills, Sunnyside, and Woodside for more social settings. Elmhurst is right there for food. 

Just realize you're in a seriously close knit community full of families. It's a great place to live and raise a family, but it's a drag if you're young and looking to meet new people and get laid.

A: Psst, surrounding "neighborhoods" they're all part of NYC :)

Juniper Park is pretty awesome for the ball fields, dog run etc, in the summer, forest Park is great but it's literally -- carved out of a forest. 

Most people have never even heard of Middle Village, I'm curious how you ended up there, it really doesn't appeal to young people looking for social life, unfortunately. It's where people move to *get away* from city bustle and live in a more suburban style. 

The q54 runs down metropolitan ave to the more active parts of southern Forest Hills and Kew Gardens which would be an option if you live in the southern part of MV. There are some new bars that are supposed to be good around Ascan ave area, and quite a few good restaurants.  KG has a few bars popular with airline staff, but isn't very happening honestly.  Northern forest hills/Austin st is an awkward 2-bus ride away, I don't know if it's really worth it. 

MV is in a geographically isolated area that isn't easy to get around without a car.  Again, I'm very confused how you ended up there. 

I kind of don't know what to tell you, Do you work in Manhattan?  Check out meetup groups they are all over.

A: I don't have a car and honestly don't even know much about surrounding towns lol. I definitely want to check out some of the parks when it gets warmer I really like playing basketball and going for short runs.

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car?

There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. 

I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) 

Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and  pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

A: I'm in Middle Village. Honestly I'd be satisfied with anything to keep me occupied when I'm not working. I've been looking into gyms in the area not really sure which one catches my eye though. Maybe a bar or something that shows basketball games. I'm into other recreational hobbies but it's not legal here :( lol. Are there any good music venues nearby? Any comedy clubs or something? Not use to the city life yet

A: Welcome!  What part of Queens are you in?  It's a very diverse borough in terms of cultures and things to do, so knowing which neighborhood you're in and what you'd be interested in would be helpful.

Q: Ok gotcha. Definitely a weird story but hey life happens right? And you can't argue with a free/cheap place to stay, that's a fact.  But most people don't even realize that there are super boring suburbanish areas of NYC. You're definitely having a unique experience... For good or ill.

So if your up on the Northern side of MV, by the mall you're more oriented to Queens Boulevard than Metropolitan. You can get on the R or M and head to 71st-Continental which is the stop for Forest Hills. the Tap Room shows a ton of sports as does Austin Public. Five Burros (next door to Tap Room) also has a very lively bar but it can be super crowded! In the other direction you have Jackson Heights which is known as an Indian/Colombian neighborhood but is more and more popular with everyone.  Mainly I go there for the delicious food and my sign language meetup group ;) 

I think you should definitely look for a sports league or volunteer opportunity just to get out and meet people. It's tough in the winter as everyone is just keeping their head down right now! Spring will come and you should look into some stuff to do. 


A: Oh lol. I answered how I moved up here in a reply to someone below it's a long boring story. I work only a little while away in the mall. When it gets better outside ill venture out to manhattan and other places I'm sure I can keep myself busy when it's warmer out lol

Andy's for sandwiches, Silver Barn for groceries, Framboise for pastries is my recommendation. I'm loyal to Steve's on Eliot for Pizza, but Rosas on Metro is superb.

There are some new bars that are supposed to be good around Ascan ave area, and quite a few good restaurants.  KG has a few bars popular with airline staff, but isn't very happening honestly.  Northern forest hills/Austin st is an awkward 2-bus ride away, I don't know if it's really worth it. 

MV is in a geographically isolated area that isn't easy to get around without a car.  Again, I'm very confused how you ended up there. 

I kind of don't know what to tell you, Do you work in Manhattan?  Check out meetup groups they are all over. 

Q: Psst, surrounding "neighborhoods" they're all part of NYC :)

Juniper Park is pretty awesome for the ball fields, dog run etc, in the summer, forest Park is great but it's literally -- carved out of a forest.

A: I don't have a car and honestly don't even know much about surrounding towns lol. I definitely want to check out some of the parks when it gets warmer I really like playing basketball and going for short runs.

A: Middle village is a pretty quiet neighborhood in and of itself. Are you north of juniper park or south if it? Do you have a car?

There are bars down metropolitan on the other side of Woodhaven -- I'm sure some show sports. Some nice restaurants too. 

I run in Forest Park when the weathers not shit, that's pretty popular :) 

Do you like to cook? It's probably not too late to join Glendale CSA, a farm share program where pay in advance and  pickup a box of locally grown veggies each week and do some basic volunteering. Nice way to meet neighbors.

A: I'm in Middle Village. Honestly I'd be satisfied with anything to keep me occupied when I'm not working. I've been looking into gyms in the area not really sure which one catches my eye though. Maybe a bar or something that shows basketball games. I'm into other recreational hobbies but it's not legal here :( lol. Are there any good music venues nearby? Any comedy clubs or something? Not use to the city life yet

Q: If you run there is a neat looking running club that meets a few times a week in Astoria - the [Hellgate Road Runners](http://www.hrronline.org/index.htm). I really want to join but it's a bit of a hike from where I am in Jackson Heights. Maybe when it is nicer!

Someone asked something similar once and I remember someone mentioned a dart tournament or something like that. It might have been in the Jackson Heights subreddit....

There are also some volunteer options - I found a few through [New York Cares](https://www.newyorkcares.org/). You have to register and go to a short orientation but then you can look at a map of all different types of events, both one-time and recurring. There is a huge variety of volunteer activities. I haven't been here that long and it has just been nice to have someone expect me somewhere around the neighborhood. 
A: Cool I'll look into that thanks!

What's something you did as a kid that was so bad, you haven't told your parents to this day? [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: I was at my cousins house when we were both 12 I believe. Me and him for some reason started to light random things on fire and throw them out the window. We even had local kids across the street cheering us on so we took an empty 2 liter Pepsi bottle and sprayed a ton of perfume in it and when we lit it, flames spewed out like a flamethrower and it startled us so we chucked it out the window and seconds later the other kids ran away. We didn't think anything of it until about five minutes later out mother came running upstairs and dragged us outside because the garage was on fire. Police and firemen came an questioned us and even those kids but no one said anything. I'm sure they found all the things we set in fire and told our parents but we never spoke of it.

If Stone Cold returned today to the WWE, who would you most like to see receive a stunner? What?

Q: What do you think?
A: I could see the miz having him on his talk show. Miz comes down the ramp but no mizdow to be found. 
Glass shatters and out comes Damian Coldow in a bald cap and vest. He begins to do the four corner poses but miz cuts him off. Miz yells yada yada the real Austin comes out and cuts a little promo poking fun at Coldow every now and then. He gets beers thrown in the ring when Coldow catches one of the cans. Before he can open it miz slaps the can out if coldows hand and Coldow hits miz with a stunner. The crowd goes insane assuming their not in Memphis and right when Coldow turns around bam Austin hits him with a stunner.

[DC TV-verse] Why there is no Batman or Superman What if the Oliver queen is the batman of the tv-verse and flash is the superman of the same universe, it would explain why supes and bats are never mentioned. Oliver has Diggle instead of Alfred Felicity instead of oracle, New black canary instead of bat girl and arsenal instead of robin What if the justice league movies are split into two part because there will be a crises on the infinite earths, arrow vs batman, flash vs superman, ATOM vs cyborg. Thoughts?

Your favorite 'smart' character -vs- your favorite 'strong' character. For this battle I want you to choose your favorite character that you feel represents Brains over brawn, and pit them against your favorite character you feel represents Brawn over brains. The scenario is this, your favorite smart character has one month,and whatever resources they could acquire in that month to plan for your favorite bloodlusted strong character to come kill them. Who are the characters, and who wins? For instance: IronMan vs Bloodlusted Hulk. The answer might be Iron Man pulls out Hulk buster times one month of prep, and wins. Which is totally valid, albeit a bit boring.

A: Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang theory) vs Smallville tv show version of Clark Kent who has one of them red rocks that make him psycho.

Howard Walowitz tries building a time machine and Sheldon is the first to volunteer to use it. Turns out he accidentally built a dimensional transporter an Sheldon winds up in metropolis . Being a the comic book enthusiast he is, Sheldon immediately recognizes where he is when we stumbles upon the daily planet. As he walks in he sees on a television set in the lobby that an unknown masked assailant is terrorizing the city and he figures out who it is easily when he notices the bullets that cops shoot at him bounce right off. 
Sheldon is instantly intrigued and notices lex Luthor leaving the building. They talk and Sheldon tries to manipulate Lex into getting him kryptonite but Lex plays dumb and leaves, ordering one of his guards to follow Sheldon. 
With one month preparation Sheldon is easily able to locate some kryptonite and begin planning his onslaught against Kent. 
The month goes by and Sheldon locates the evil Clark robbing a bank near the end of the city limits. as Clark leaves the bank he sees Sheldon in the street wearing a suit of armor with a large kryptonite rock embedded in the middle of his chest. In the knuckles of his armored fists are small fragments of kryptonite. Sheldon has many other tricks up his sleeve knowing more about Kents weaknesses than Kent knows himself. They both run towards each other and they throw a punch at the same time. The moment their fists meet a large flash engulfs them and they both wake up in a large stadium. Looking around they see others looking at them seeming as confused as they are. Sheldon recognizes some from other comics he's read and others he noticed were animated characters who were know in human form.
Magneto, sasuke uchiha(naruto), wonder woman, master chief (halo), and batman. 
The camera then pans up leading to an overhead view of the arena and as the camera raises higher and higher the arena gets smaller and smaller until it's revealed Howard Walowitz is watching from a wizard of oz type crystal ball with an evil grin on his face.

Found this big guy in the attic. Can someone identify for me/is it worth anything?

Q: I was following those monsters on Ebay awhile back but they keep getting bid up over my personal five buck limit. They definitely have some value to collectors, /u/zcs90's estimate of $25 USD sounds about right. 

http://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces20341.html

"Notgeld" means that it was emergency token coinage (and sometimes bills) issued by a local authority, and not actual legal tender issued by the national government. There was a lot of that going on in Germany back then.

I used to have this huge cloth poster type thing which was all black and white and had the warrior in the middle with so many cool graphics around it, it was even signed and im shamed to say it got ruined in a flood years ago.

Q: It was all just a life insurance scam.
A: Or a perfect storyline setup by Vince. At Hell in a Cell Alberto Del Rio will be standing in the ring waiting for John Cenas music to start playing when Vickies music plays instead. She stands at the top of the ramp and goes on to tell Del Rio that she was tricking him into thinking Cena would be his opponent so he'd be completely thrown off guard when she announces his new opponent. "You think I'm going to make you the face of the wwe just because you sweet talk me a little? Well I got news for you Del Rio, I'm taken..BY THIS MAN" Then you hear it.. "VIVA LA RASAAA" And the return is complete and Vince is a genius.

It's a rear tie rod that's snapped.  See here, it's #8: http://www.newgmparts.com/parts/2000/CHEVROLET/IMPALA/?siteid=213815&vehicleid=1358030&diagram=NHP080

This should be replaced ASAP, as your wheel's gonna be out of alignment otherwise... not only will your tire start wearing away rather quickly, your car's handling could become unsafe: you could spin out much easier.  You'll need an alignment once this part is replaced, too.

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year, but have a crush on a new guy.. am I terrible person? So my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. Last week, though, I met this guy and I have a huge crush on him.. to the point where when he smiles at me, I swear my heart jumps a little. The thing is, I only have a little while with this new guy until I'll most likely never see him again. (I'm on vacation). I thought I loved my boyfriend, but I feel like if that were true, I wouldn't like this new guy. So a few questions... Should I tell my boyfriend? Should I break up with him when I get home? Am I terrible person for liking someone else?

Q: What isn't fair to your boyfriend is slutting it up on vacation and then "feeling bad" for your boyfriend and breaking up with because it is the right thing to do. Why don't you confess to him what you did and how you feel and give him the chance to break up with you? Or is it you think if you break up with your boyfriend then maybe you can "still be friends" with him because you like him so much and he is a great guy?  You know what?  Do what ever you want.  I have no respect for twats like you anyway.
A: No, that's not what I meant. I just meant that if I have feelings for this guy, it could happen with someone else. And that wouldn't be fair to my boyfriend..

Q: No, that's not what I meant. I just meant that if I have feelings for this guy, it could happen with someone else. And that wouldn't be fair to my boyfriend..
A: yes, you should break up with your current boyfriend in favor of a guy you probably will never see again.  That is the mature thing to do.

Songs about loneliness? Hey reddit, I've been listening to a lot of music lately. I really like Adam's Song, Creep, and A Better Place a Better Time. I was wondering if anyone could give me some songs about being alone. Most of the songs I find are about being lonely after a relationship has ended; however, I've never been in one, so I was wondering if there were any songs that fit my pathetic position. I don't really like hard rock too much, I'm looking for more late Green Day and late blink182 style songs. Whatever you can find, though, is fine with me. Thanks! **TL;DR** Looking for songs about loneliness, none talking about having previous relationships

Q: Or just listen to "Hit the Switch" by Bright Eyes. It's a wonderful song.
A: Landlocked blues and First day of my life are good too. Pretty much everything Conner Oberst makes is beautiful. ;)

The Vicious Kind- independent, meaningful, artistic, great soundtrack. Loved it. If you like slower indie films that intense dramas it is for you. If you are a thriller, action or mystery kind of person, not for you. Has the same tone as movies like One Hour Photo, Cashback, Everything Must Go, you would like this

Q: What do you think?
A: A few things about this movie I watched directly because of this post. (am drunk)
1. I never thought I'd be able to see Adam Scott in a damn good serious role.
2. I am oficially in love with Brittany Snow
4. I'm glad I don't have an older brother 
and 3. This film makes you (at least it did me( be weary of trusting females.

Q: Any crazy stories, like weird customers or events?
A: Tons and tons. One that stands out the most mainly because it happened on my first week: Me and the kid I worked with at the time were both on register and this really attractive slutty dressed girl comes in stumbling and goes to the bathroom. About twenty minutes or so she comes out and walks over to my register with a box of trident gum and as I'm ringing her out she pulls her phone out and starts giggling. She then says "Wanna see something funny" and im like sure, so she shows me a picture of her naked in our bathroom. She kept laughing and went on t osay "I pretty much made your night huh" And left after paying for the gum. Will never forget.

Like I said, I only say it because, hard as it might be to believe, I care about you, even though I don't know you.  I've been where you are, and it kills me to know that you are going through this shit when you don't need to be.

Q: Going through the same shit as OP and this made me smile. Thank you sir for actually making me feel better about myself. Wish someone would of said this to me when it first happened. 
A: I don't want to be that guy, but fucking get over it.  Trust me, it's what you need to hear, even though it's harsh.  Just get over yourself.

You've created this idyllic image of your former partner that isn't even fucking close to what they really were.  If they allowed what their parents thought of you to influence their own thoughts of you, guess what?  It was never gonna work.  She had doubts of her own, and the thing with her parents only made her realize these doubts.

If she hadn't broken up with you, you would have gotten married, and eventually divorced.  That would be loads worse, now wouldn't it?

You're living in a world of self-pity, screaming oh woe is me, as though you are the only person to experience heart ache.  She was just a fucking girl, and apparently a shitty one.  You need to realize this.

Trust me, I've gone through the same thing.  I was engaged to a woman I thought I was going to spend my life with, and she left me for no real reason.  I hated myself for years, never going anywhere, just living the way you do.  Eventually, I realized how terrible our relationship was, and I hated the person I had become.  I was acting like a fucking piece of shit, and all over a fucking girl.  So I pulled myself together and got over it.

Q: And I'd drink said beer and buy us a shot.  I could use more local friends lol.
A: Yeah, most advice I got was "Dude don't worry you's will get back together" or "dude just hit up the bar and get some slut to blow you you'll forget about her". My friends aren't the brightest.. First bad break up so didn't really know how to handle but fuck it, I'm too good for her anyway. I'd buy you a beer good man if I could.

A: Same here.  I wish someone would have said it to me after my bad break-up.  

Like I said, I only say it because, hard as it might be to believe, I care about you, even though I don't know you.  I've been where you are, and it kills me to know that you are going through this shit when you don't need to be.

A: I don't want to be that guy, but fucking get over it.  Trust me, it's what you need to hear, even though it's harsh.  Just get over yourself.

You've created this idyllic image of your former partner that isn't even fucking close to what they really were.  If they allowed what their parents thought of you to influence their own thoughts of you, guess what?  It was never gonna work.  She had doubts of her own, and the thing with her parents only made her realize these doubts.

If she hadn't broken up with you, you would have gotten married, and eventually divorced.  That would be loads worse, now wouldn't it?

You're living in a world of self-pity, screaming oh woe is me, as though you are the only person to experience heart ache.  She was just a fucking girl, and apparently a shitty one.  You need to realize this.

Trust me, I've gone through the same thing.  I was engaged to a woman I thought I was going to spend my life with, and she left me for no real reason.  I hated myself for years, never going anywhere, just living the way you do.  Eventually, I realized how terrible our relationship was, and I hated the person I had become.  I was acting like a fucking piece of shit, and all over a fucking girl.  So I pulled myself together and got over it.

Best books to start reading? So I never really actually sat down and read an entire book from beginning to end. I want to start, especially with my new job where i have tons of time.

Q: Depends on what you like?

What kind of movies did you enjoy watching? drama, horror, science fiction, romance?
A: I like a mix of everything really, never really been into the sci fi thing though. Always liked movies that made me think about life or something of that matter.

That awkward moment that triggers a wrestling related memory. So I'm currently sitting next to my step dad in the hospital. I can't help but imagine Stone Cold walking in the room and hitting someone with a bed pan. This has to happen to people more often than I imagine. Like attending a funeral and just waiting for the reanimated corpse of the Big Bossman to show up and drag the casket across the cemetery. Which happens to me. Every time. Any more situations out there? [I love you, Stone Cold](http://youtu.be/pgbQYAdtYUc)

Who do you want to see fight? If you could choose any two naruto characters to fight to the death who would they be and what about them makes you believe it would be a good fight? My choices: Kakashi and Guy, They have been rivals for years and not once have we seen them in a real fight against each other. And the Second Hokage and Kisame, they are both extremely good water justu users and I would love to see who is the better one. What do you guys think?

Q: If you want to see Sasuke vs Kakashi there's a great fan animation on youtube that depicts such a fight.  [I'll link it for you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZjrg4wrMWk).  The action starts around 6 minutes, but the english dub isn't too bad and is probably worth a listen.  
A: Sasuke vs Kakashi would be one of my favorites. Just the history between them it would be interesting to see teacher vs student and the power of each of there sharingans go at it even though I think sasukes eyes are obviously better.

Also Shikamaru vs Neji. They never really had any big history together but they're both incredibly talented and smart it would be interesting to see how they use their different skills against one another.

Would you rather fight a clone of yourself or 100 2-inch tall clones of yourself? Help me resolve this argument with my friend He insists the clone is the better answer, which I can't see at all The clone would be just as strong as you, it'd all be down to whoever manages to pull something sneaky first With 100 2-inch clones of yourself, there's not much they can really do They would be tiny in comparison to you, and could probably be dealt with by stomping around a bit So Reddit, what would you go for? And of course, explain why

Q: What do you think?

But could you also add a reason behind what makes whatever film/show a good one, and whether or not your suggestion is a movie or series, please.

Q: Begin living in the "now." Right at this moment do what you know is right and needs doing. Whatever that may be, do it with your entire attention. 

If you are washing your hands, wash them the absolute best you can, paying attention to the feel of the water, the color of the soap, the sound of the water, and the color of the towel you use to dry.

Stop running scenarios about the future in your mind. Stop examining the past. Live for what is happening right now. Take care of what needs doing right now the best you are able, and the future will sort itself out in fine order.

This is spelled out in a great book: "The Power of Now" by Eckhart Tolle if you're interested.
A: Sounds good, but isn't everything we do ultimately altering our future? It sounds easy to not think about it but its always going to play a big part in how I determine on what I will do in the present.

A: Couldn't anyone go on there and say it was anyone? The scribbled out Chris on the notebook in the latest video was a clue I'm guessing. I'd like it to be Jericho and WWE seems to be doing pretty well with pleasing the fans as of late. The start of 2012 with the return of Jericho would be awesome.

If these wrestlers hadn't passed away, do you think that they would've stuck around with WWE or would they have eventually left? - Owen Hart - Chris Benoit - Eddie Guerrero

Q: What do you think?

Wreddit's Slammy Awards Before Monday's Slammy Awards, I'd love to hear Wreddit's thoughts on this past year! Without getting too complex, I threw together some categories (but certainly are not limited to) that are up for discussion: * Superstar of the Year * Breakout Performer of the Year * Heel of the Year * Best Moment/Surprise/Pop of the Year * Match of the Year * Wredditor of the Year This isn't necessarily a prediction thread for the results for Monday, more of our own discussion on who REALLY should win.

Q: What do you think?
A: * Superstar of the year : CM Punk

* Breakout Performer of the Year : Cody Rhodes

* Heel of the Year : Mark Henry, Mainly because he is really the only heel that acts like a genuine bad guy.

* BEst Moment/Surprise/Pop of the Year : The Rock being announced as Wrestlemania Host I think got the biggest pop.

* Match of the Year : CM Punk vs John Cena at MITB 

*Wredditor of the Year : MickFoley

You book the match endings. Okay, so I want to start by saying that I usually hate the corny, terrible, match endings like Cena vs Batista last man standing where Cena taped Batista to the ring post, and won, but...yeah Match endings to me can make or break the match. If it's a great and super amazing match, but the ending is terrible you feel cheated, but it can also save a bad match is the ending was good. I've had this match ending in my head for a while now, and the Royal Rumble isn't that far away: 1. Royal Rumble starts out with say Santino and Jay Uso (this doesn't matter) 2. The 3rd persons time ticks down, and you hear "You know, I got ya, yeah--one; break the walls down" big pop from the crowd, but no Jericho. 3. Match continues, and Big Show & Kane form an alliance (this works since they were together before the Hall of Pain hit) 4. Kane or Show wins, and the winner celebrates, the ref calls for the bell raises his arm, confetti falls...whatever. 5. He steps over the top rope and exits the ring like the normal big guys do, and walks up the ramp and into the back. 6. Jericho comes out from under the ring, ref recalls decision, and Jericho is laughing and smiling pointing to his head, and is holding a smart phone with the ppv streaming (from wwe.com of course). 7. fade to black. What are some match ending ideas that you've come up with?

Q: What do you think?
A: I'd love Jericho to return at the Rumble but I wouldn't want him to win it. Personally I don't like when a wrestler makes a return at the rumble to win. I like to see the guy build up momentum going towards it then winnning like Del Rio did. Not like Edge the year before.

Q: That's what I've been saying, but just a little different. I've been saying that Bryan will lose the MITB briefcase to Alberto at the Rumble, then make a surprise entrance and win the whole thing.

A: It would be nice to see Kane finally win a Rumble but I just can't see it happening.

Last Night... Last night was the first time I'd ever watched anything wrestling-related. My friend managed to get free box seats at the arena on the day of, and I must admit I had much more fun than I expected to, despite having no idea what was going on. Luckily I saw the ad on the sidebar, and I had one main question: Who was the guy that C.M. Punk was talking to, that sounded a lot like Bob Einstein / Marty Funkhouser? He seemed to get a large amount of booing (I was actually reading during this part), along with a few of the Mexican wrestlers. P.S. I didn't know they were allowed to do fireworks indoors. I wish presidential speeches began like that.

A question I never dared to ask regarding sex scenes in movies I've always been that kid living trough that awkward moment when watching a movie together with my parents and a nude woman was to be seen, or, sex was had. The last thing I would have screamed in such a moment was "Are they doing it for real"? I haven't seen many movies with sex scenes, neither full-on nor implied, just doesn't seem to cross my prefered genre But there are some movies where I really ask myself, there is no way they are faking it, isn't there? Topless? Kissing? One body is hiding the other? Alright, we either cut to the "morning after" or use good camera angles, they probably don't even have to lose underwear if done right. But there are some movies where this doesn't seem to be the case. So what happens? Shoving it somewhere else? This happens quite often in Korean cinema it seems. Camera angles that sort of imply that there is no one penetrating a bag instead. Then there are of course movies like Brown Bunny where there is no way to fake it. Is this an odd question to raise? Are the actors who do such thing just very open minded? Luckily not to be in a relationship? Or are there even cases where boyfriends allowed there acting girlfriends to have sex for a role? Or are 99,999% of these cases, even the one where it really seems to be real (visibly no panties) just good acting? What scenes are there where it is known that real penetration occured (asking it this way the whole question really sounds silly). **tl;dr** How many sex scenes are real? [edit] Of course movies which are not marketed as (softcore) porn are meant.

What is a movie that you will not watch again, because it was too rough to sit through? I was pondering this question after sitting in my film class, and we watched the one movie I told myself I would never watch again "Requiem for a Dream", and sure enough for aspects of film editing what do we watch "Requiem for a Dream". My reason as to why I will not watch this Aronofsky masterpiece is the last act in that movie, but more specifically what happens to Marion. The degradation of character to perform the acts she does, just to get her fix is something that will be burned in my mind forever. This does not exclude what happens to Tyrone, Harry, and Sara. But that last act is why I won't watch this movie again, seeing it for a grade yes, but just out of free time, no.

r/SquaredCircle, What's the worst possible match you can think of? I pose a challenge: Come up with the worst wrestling match that could ever possibly take place. Just so we don't get too crazy, here are the ground rules: **1. It can include any wrestlers, living or dead** **2. It must obey the laws of physics and human conditioning (no 14 week iron man matches, John Cena clones, or fights on Mars)** So, let's see who can channel the creative powers of Vince Russo and come up with the most horrid matchup.

Q: What do you think?
A: Scott Steiner vs Mason Ryan in a 2 out of 3 falls match. First will be a debating match where the 2 have 10 minutes each to argue why they're so genetically dominant. 2nd match, bra and panties.. If there is a 3rd it will be an all out, no holds barred one hand ties behind there backs bull rope match. Winner gets Natalyas hand in marriage.

Does a Barrett/Regal feud sound good to anyone else? I understand that it involves pushing Regal, which, obviously, WWE isn't willing to do. However, I see some potential in it. Remember that the WWE is pushing Barrett as a "bare-knuckle champion", a very uncivilized, angry character that happens to have a British accent. Have Regal call him a disgrace to the Crown or something of the sort, and end that with Barrett wastelanding Regal through a table in the back. Obviously that sets up a few glorious matches in the ring between brawler and technician. Anyone else think this would be awesome?

Q: I just wonder who D-Bry could fight at Wrestlemania that could put on a good show with him? His match with Mark was good, but I feel like he could put on a better match with someone like Wade Barret or Christian. I've been thinking that D-Bry is going to lose his briefcase before the year is over, and somehow win the Rumble. But who knows? NOT ME!
A: Have D-Bry win the WHC at WM28, and somehow put him in with Regal in a feud over the belt, a "battle of the technicians" if you will. I like it.

What are your Wrestlemania 28 card predictions? Tickets are about to go on sale, so now is as good of a time as ever to predict what the card will look like. I have to say this is really tough to pinpoint for me... Cena says his match with Rock will be for the WWE Championship. Daniel Bryan says he's going to cash in his MiTB for a championship match at Wrestlemania. The winner of the Royal Rumble gets a world title shot. That's three title matches but only two titles. Oh well, here goes. - The Rock vs. John Cena - Daniel Bryan vs. CM Punk (c) (WWE Championship) [I haven't decided which one of these guys would turn heel.] - Randy Orton vs. Sheamus (c) (World Heavyweight Championship) [Orton would be a heel by now.] - HHH vs. Undertaker - Alberto del Rio vs. Big Show - Cody Rhodes vs. Mason Ryan (Intercontinental vs. US Champion) - The Miz, R-Truth, Christian, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger vs. Santino Marella, Zack Ryder, Alex Riley, Kofi Kingston, Evan Bourne (Elimination Tag... or some other kind of gimmick match. I'd love to see MiTB back.) - Rey Mysterio vs. Sin Cara [Face vs. face I guess.] - Mark Henry vs. Kane - An awful Diva's match -- Is Kharma supposed to be back yet? That was harder than I thought -- A lack of MiTB means throwing all of the mid to uppermid carders into a random tag match. Meh.

Q: What do you think?
A: Undertaker vs Wade Barrett--WWE Championship The Rock vs John Cena (Cena wins Chamber match causing punk to lose.Cena looses wm, becomes heel to feud with rock until mitb) -- IC title match- Cody Rhodes vs Randy Orton. (Orton winning, causing ic title to become more mainstream again) -- US Title - Ziggler vs Jack Swagger --Rey Mysterio vs Alberto Del Rio -- CM Punk vs Kevin Nash-- world championship Mark Henry vs Kane vs Daniel Bryan -- Zack Ryder, sin cara, air boom vs christian, miz, r truth, and hunico -- Just a thought lol, I think it would be cool. couldnt think of a random mid card throw in lol

Q: [Kevin Rudolf - Let It Rock ft. Lil Wayne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0n4eMGXAyk&ob=av3e)

Before you judge, I'll tell you how to make this work:

* The stage would be hollywood style searchlights, green and yellow ambience.
* Lots and lots of fogs on my entranceway
* Pyro in the middle of "Dir-ty" in the first line: I see your, dir-(pyro)-ty face, hide behind the..."
* Another pyro section the way shawn michaels does in his ring, but along side the titantron. It will happen as I begin a gesture (jump up like I was jumproping, fistpumping with my finger to the sky) during "i maaaaaade myyyyyyyyy" and end it by pointing a sweeping motion [as soon as the chorus hits]
* My gimmick is an easygoing party kid (hell i'd even job every weekn and wouldn't mind) with the highflying style of Evan Bourne and the cunning of Edge. With that gimmick, the most I could probably achieve is the US Title, in a wonderful crowd-popping underdog fluke program where everyone loves me but expects me to lose (you know, because I'm a jobber). And then I start running up and down the arena like a boy in a candy store and yell and high five the fans.

the most i would hold that first reign would be 2 weeks tops, where i valiantly try to defeat the scripted winner, and end up on my knees, head low and feeling disappointed at myself after the match... and evolve my character a little bit to make myself more determined to win it back.

*sigh*... a man can dream.

Then have Cody Rhodes in a stable with Daniel Bryan, Christian and Wade Barret to uprise against Cena with Rhodes leading the pack and eventually taking the title from Cena. First Wrestlemania will see Ziggler vs Punk with both championships on the line. John Cena vs Cody Rhodes(royal rumble winner) for world championship. Ryder vs. D.Bryan for US title.

Did anyone else get a Cowboy Bebop vibe watching the movie Drive? I don't know if it's just me but between the soundtrack and the awkward "love" story between the two it just reminded me alot of Cowboy Bebop lol

Q: What do you think?
A: I think the way the songs they'd play with the female singer going along with the slow pace montage sort of scenes stood out most when comparing to to Bebop.

Okay, r/movies, give me your 15 favorite movies. Favorite, not best. Fifteen favorite movies, no ranking necessary. I'm asking this for the same reason I love large "best movies" lists: I don't care about the ranking, I'm looking for awesome films I haven't seen. Yeah, there might be a lot of Fight Clubs, but that one "Spirit of the Beehive" will make it all worthwhile. Bonus points if people want to reply with recommendations based on someone's list. My favorite films would be: Eraserhead, Boogie Nights, Stardust Memories, Miller's Crossing, Rushmore, Jesus' Son, Reservoir Dogs, Die Hard, The Grand Illusion, The Killing, Children Of Men, Life Of Brian, Broadway Danny Rose, High and Low, The Conversation

Q: What do you think?
A: -Reservoir Dogs
-No Country for Old Men
-Dazed and COnfused
-American Beauty
-Super
-Forrest Gump
-Oldboy
-Taxi Driver
-Phone Booth
-Gangs of New York
-Casino
-Trainspotting
-Inglourious Basterds

What non mainstream match would you recommend to others, and vice-versa? I'd love to see the opinions of people here as to what non mainstream match, or show, you'd recommend to existing wrestling fans and why. They can already be puro, lucha, or indy fans, so the concern isn't as much a match to keep them watching or ditch the mainstream. And just for fun let's also include mainstream matches you'd use to convince mainstream haters that WWE/TNA isn't all that bad. For me it would have to be the Up in Smoke to FIST for the CDP in CHIKARA. Sure Cloudy vomits, but UIS make great underdogs and I think the match does the 2/3 falls stipulation really well. My other pick would have to be Drew Mcintyre vs Chris Masters from Superstars. Great back and forth match that told a story, made both men look good, and given just enough time. Great example of what CM Punk meant about Masters' release.

Q: What do you think?
A: I enjoyed the CM Punk vs Bryan Danielson match.

My boyfriend puts his friends over me, am I overreacting? He is always hanging out with/ texing his friends. Guys and girls. It makes me feel left out because he doesn't spend as much time with just me, or include me with his friends. I talked to him about it and he said he wouldn't do that anymore, but it's just kept happening...what should I do?

Q: exactly happened to me too you don't even realize it from her point of view
A: My girlfriend actually just confronted me about the same thing. She had to threaten to break up with me if it continued because when she'd say something about it before I would say she's overreacting and it's no big deal. Only when she told me she'd leave me if it continued did I realize how big of a deal it was. The important thing was she made sure to let me know she wasn't making me choose between her and my friends but made it clear that she just wanted to be involved more which I began to do and its better now. So put some scare in him, don't make him choose. Hope it helps lol

New New World Order - for Survivor Series http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/5798/nwodg.jpg Just threw this picture together watching RAW. It makes more sense than you would think. It's actually very similar (if it turns out this way) to a storyline that I have written. It is that the people clamoring that there is a conspiracy, ARE the conspirators all along. They are the agents of change and control whilst creating the illusion that they are at the mercy of the problem. What better group fits this than the NWO?

Q: What do you think?
A: I like it. I don't think Punk would be a heel though but the way the writers are throwing things together anymore who knows lol.

My tattoo is not healing great..suggestions? [deleted]

Q: What do you think?
A: My friends dad told me to put peroxide on the tattoo to heal the scabbing faster. The scabbing has gone down alot than what it was without using the peroxide at all. Is peroxide a good method? I am skeptical of using it but if it heals faster I'll try it. At this point i dont even care how the tattoo looks afterwards I talked to a local artist with his own shop he said he can fix it once it heals.

A: i thought so :) you just reminded me of my boyfriend. he's the same way. like he listened to stuff like three inches of blood (i think?) but now he pretty much just listens to mastodon. he's also expanded to other genres like country, which is on the total other end of the spectrum haha.

A: It used to be unhealthy the amount of metal I used to listen to. I still listen to some, but around senior year of high school I opened up to a lot of new generes and now I listen to pretty much everything.

Q: Plain ol' cocoa/shea butter once or twice a day when it's looking extra dry works wonders for me. Aquaphor for 3 days is really dynamite, though. I'm kinda pissed I didn't know about that for my older ones.
A: I do aquaphor for the first 3 days and then nothing after,  I've not found a lotion that does not make me itch like crazy.

Judgemental

Q: What do you think?
A: You'll do ridiculous things to make people laugh..but you keep the ridiculousness to a limit. You play an instrument and if not you'd like to but just don't have the time or patience to learn. You're single but have no problems meeting women who fill that gap in your life with meaningless sex. I would have a beer with you because you also seem like the guy who at a bar, would get your friends laid before you see to yourself.
