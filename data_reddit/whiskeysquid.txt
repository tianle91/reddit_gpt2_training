Q: Just happened to me. Glad to see I‚Äôm not the only one
A: Weirdest thing happened last night. I was playing with 2 randos and was the champion squad going into the game. Mid game it cuts to the loading screen and goes into the legend select screen with the same randos i was with. We weren't champion squad going in but when we got the jumpship there was only 7 squads in game and the circle reset so us 7 squads had the entire map to loot. Never seen or heard this happening before.

Petition to make RPAN a permanent thing Twitch might do the same thing with IRL streams, but the magic is with RPAN that you don't have to be a famous streamer with an established personality for people to actually watch you. RPAN is raw humanity - the good, the bad, and the weird - put on display for everyone to see, and that's what makes it so unique and refreshing. I would love to see this expanded with things like subreddit specific streams and more available slots in the future.

(Showerthought) This would have been fuckin' diabolical.

Q: What I expected was he wasn't going to be invisible when the bomb exploded, which makes us see the explosion come out of every hole in his body because the explosion got so compressed since his body was indestructable.  

We'll get to see his eyeballs pop out, bleed out his ears, nose and eyesockets, and see some of his tiny inside guts pour down his ass.

Makes me feel queezy just imagining how fucked up that would have been combined with what you said
A: I thought when he exploded it would only have been his insides and he'd just be laying there, skin in tact. Kind of like when an ice cream bar melts inside the wrapper

$18 a skin still to much In regards to Respawn‚Äôs reply to the Iron Crown event, $18 per skin is way too much to ask. $18 is gas for a couple days to work, that‚Äôs a home cooked meal, for some that‚Äôs a pack of smokes or beer. It‚Äôs a laugh to want to spend that much to look a certain way in a video game. Granted, this isn‚Äôt the first time a label has pushed high prices on their fans. I could understand $5-10. That gives support to the devs/pubs and doesn‚Äôt make the fans feel guilty/torn. Also not everyone that plays this game is of age and has a job! Could you imagine, ‚ÄúMom, Dad, can I have $5 to buy a skin?‚Äù, ‚ÄúMom, Dad, can I have $20 to buy a skin?‚Äù Which one do you think they‚Äôd go for? I appreciate the devs trying to right a wrong, but from the beginning it‚Äôs been to much. Sure $18 to get exactly what you want is better than $21 on 3 chances to gamble on what you want. But, is it fan friendly? I know some devs/pubs don‚Äôt GAF about fan friendly, but do you think you‚Äôd have a healthier fan base if you weren‚Äôt gouging? Don‚Äôt you think they‚Äôd earn more? Also, yes, FTP(Free to play), you can opt out of any of this and just not pay for skins, or anything for that matter. But, shouldn‚Äôt you feel enticed to buy, not driven away? I‚Äôve purchased the season passes, but that‚Äôs it. The pass give you something to aim for. A set of goals for a game that really has none, other than badges. I won‚Äôt spend $20 to look cool in a game. Again, I appreciate Respawn‚Äôs efforts to make the situation better, they still have missed the mark in my opinion. Edit: Think of it this way. Say you want 3 of the skins, who cares about the rest. That‚Äôs $54 you have to spend. THATS DISGUSTING! It‚Äôs literally a sick joke. As someone replied, you can buy a game for that amount with a full experience and play for months. Edit: For the record, I make on average $70k a year as a insulator by trade in the oil field in canada. Not including what my wife brings in. Insulting people and claiming people are broke because they don‚Äôt want to pay these prices makes you ignorant and immature.

Q: What do you think?
A: Skins you can't even see during gameplay

When one didnt get it he started to roast the one who did about apparently paying all this money for the wraith heirloom stuff and how he had no life blah blah. The wraith turned out to be jumpmaster and dropped instantly. I broke off from the squad pretty quick and as soon as i did the wraith dropped themselves and the douche into the furthest part of the ocean. Sacrificed his Gold rp just to get his justice.

A: Hmm good question since I changed it a few months ago it‚Äôs hard to say but off the top of my head I‚Äôd say the biggest advantage is being able to see more in your periphery. Big advantage being able to see more on the sides without having to turn. Disadvantages would be initially there‚Äôs kind of a fish bowl effect and you feel like you‚Äôre moving faster (even though of course you‚Äôre not). It can also lower performance but I‚Äôve never noticed any drops on a PS4 Pro. 

I recommend giving it a try since usually more information usually equals better especially in first person shooters.

In subreddit: PS4

I am the biggest dumbass in the history of Ps4 ownership, and I just have to share So for the past 3 hours, I have been trying to eject my Days Gone game disk from my PS4. But nothing would ever come out. It would just beep 3 times and thats it. I looked up videos online on how to manually eject a disk with a Screwdriver. After realizing I didnt have one small enough, I go over to the nearest Home Depot to buy one. I come home, try to use the screw driver, and it doesnt fucking work. I do exactly what this video tells me to do but it didnt work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPH-hweb9jo I keep trying and trying. Tapping the PS4 occasionally, looking at other videos, shaking it out of frustaration. But then it hits me. Days Gone was something I downloaded over the PSN Store. I never had a game disc to begin with. Im going to go to bed, but I needed somebody to hear my shameful story so that at least SOMETHING comes outta this, regardless of what that is
