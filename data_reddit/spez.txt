Six weeks ago I had my eyes lasered, and it's been among the best decisions of my life [removed]

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm so happy for you. I feel the same way after getting my eyes fixed almost three years ago. There are so many small day-to-day life improvements I've gotten to experience as a result. For example, falling asleep watching tv with my contacts in used to be a major mistake as I'd later have to pry stale contacts off my eyeballs while half asleep. Now, it's just falling asleep.

Reddit is such a rollercoaster for me. I keep being happy then angry then sad, because of the posts and the variaty of subs that im subscribed for. Sometimes i think about quitting the ones that makes me mad, but i also think that this is just closing my eyes to reality and just wanting to see nice things idk. What you guys think?

Q: What do you think?
A: I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features.

Cheez-its. Yay or nay? Good people of this little corner of the internet: I have just (perhaps foolishly) told my wife that I’ve never met a single person who doesn’t like Cheez-its. She says there must be someone out there that doesn’t like them. She is currently working on her own answer to this question. So if you don’t mind let’s see who is right and who is sleeping on the couch. 😃

Is there a place for coding questions where it starts really basic and the problems progress and build off each other? Basically the title. I know a lot of problems have similar solutions or principles. I'm just curious if there is a place I can go that will progressively help me learn almost like a study plan. Some times I feel like I try a problem and there is just too much context missing.

Q: What do you think?
A: I used to turn to the [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) when learning a new language. If you can do them all, I'm sure you'll find a full-time gig programming Prolog in no time.

Just want to let everyone know that no matter what problems you’re having in life it does get better. I recently went through a rough patch in my life and i was really sad about what happened but now i realized it was for the best. So i just want to let everyone know that they matter and that it does get better.

Q: What do you think?
A: Whenever I go through a rough patch, I try to remember all the rough patches I've been through already, and all the high points and happy memories in between them. Then I remind myself that every rough patch has so far eventually been followed by good times and that whatever it is, this too shall pass. And it does.

In subreddit: CasualConversation

I feel like I don’t have any “real friends” and it’s bothering me I’m not sure if I’ve just been a dumbass in my whole 19 years of living but this past week I’ve taken a step back from my friendships to examine them and honestly most of them don’t feel “genuine”, if that makes sense. In particular, this one group of friends I’ve been around since high school. They will from time to time invite me over to hang out with them or when they have a party they’ll tell me to get over there, but when I’m actually there it feels a bit disingenuous. Just little interactions, if another guest at their house gives me a hug cuz we haven’t seen each other since graduation a couple of them will follow suit. which feels extremely forced considering they don’t normally do that and I see them way more often than the guest in particular. That coupled with the fact that it doesn’t rlly feel like anybody wants to make plans with me on the off chance I ask because I assume they are my friends. It also seems like the friends I made in college are the same way, where they originally sounded like they wanted to meet up this summer, whenever I actually talk serious about it nobody wants to say when they’re free. It just makes me feel like perhaps I’m just somebody nobody really wants to be around.

Q: What do you think?
A: I think I read this on r/wholesomememes a while ago, but it's stuck with me:

*The secret to having good friends is to be a good friend.*

You can't control their feelings and actions towards you, but you can control your feelings and actions towards them. If you make the effort, give them a call, plan things, invite them, I suspect you'll find what you're looking for, whether clarity or friendship.

Will I get stuck if I accept this first job opportunity? My internship seems to be leading into an offer for full-time after graduation. I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing, but I'm nervous about just accepting the first opportunity that comes my way. Will I get stuck and have fewer opportunities if I just accept this first job? I know this question is vague, but I appreciate any advice you have for me.

Q: What if op is interning at Reddit?
A: >I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing

It's hard to find this, so I'd give strong consideration to staying.

And what does it mean to be stuck? You'd only be stuck if this was the only job available, and if this is the only job available, you have no options anyway.

In subreddit: BarefootRunning

Can barefoot running cause you to develop arches? I'm in my 40's and as long as I remember, I've had flat wide feet. Like a cartoon duck. I'm hardly an athlete, but this summer I've been working at barefoot running on grass and I'm proud to say I can now run a continuous 22 mins and cover 3.5 KM. Today while walking on the driveway I noticed that I seem to have a small arch. I inspected my feet and realized they look slightly different than I remember them, but this could be my imagination. I'm wondering if this is something others have observed. Does barefoot running "fix" or help with flat-footedness? Edit - thanks for all the feedback everyone!

Q: What do you think?
A: To echo many people here, yes, that’s been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. 

Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). 

I find that simply walking is not enough. It’s running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits.

In subreddit: NintendoSwitch

I'm a 'grown ass man'. I am getting a switch on Friday and its like reliving my childhood. Hi all, just wanted to share something that might make some of you smile. Would be fun to hear if you have had a similar experience. I’m 32. I have been gaming avidly for over 25 years, PC gamer and not had a console for over a decade. I’m a fully adult human. I have a mortgage. It’s my birthday on Friday and I am buying myself a switch. I cannot believe the level of excitement and impatience I am feeling. I feel like every minute is an hour, I keep imagining various terrible scenarios which result in me not getting the switch on Friday – it breaks, the TV doesn’t work, Friday just DOESN’T arrive. I am constantly watching youtube videos, planning exactly what I will do when I get it – what order I will get digital games in, what Nintendo online membership I will get. Made an online account weeks ago… This will be the longest work week of all time. I was thinking ‘I actually can’t remember ever feeling this level of anticipation’, then I remembered I had – as a child on those Christmas mornings getting the NES, SNES, PlayStation. The whole anticipation is bringing back so many happy memories of gaming as a child: watching my brother beating the final boss of Mario World on the SNES; playing chucky egg and grannies garden on the BBC Micro (anyone remember those?). There is something about the word ‘Nintendo that just takes me back to another time and conjures a boyish excitement in me. I am therefore doing everything possible to both heighten this excitement and increase the torture. The great irony is that I already have my switch and the games and accessories. I am a ‘grown ass man’, I have bought this with my own money and could open it any time I wish. No one would care. Instead I am forcing myself to wait until my birthday. I have even made a wee pile of the switch and everything else I have bought in a prominent place in the living room where it can torture and tantalise me. I am speaking to all my colleagues in work who have switches. Never off this reddit. My girlfriend finds this extremely amusing and is ribbing me mercilessly about it, which is part of the fun. There is so much negative reporting about gaming in the media so I wanted to share how much I am enjoying the sense of pure fun, joy, and excitement. I feel sorry for people who don’t know how rewarding gaming can be. This Friday morning – I am opening my switch in my dressing gown at 7am like its Christmas morning 1997. Christmas f'ing morning for a 32 year-old, slightly greying, small child.

Q: This is how i felt whe buying the switch. Im 27 and have been gaming since i was really young. Ive jad a faming pc for over 8 years and buying the switch and playing zelda breath of the wild made me relive moments i had when i was a younger me playing ocarina of time.
A: Video games were a huge part of growing up for me until World of Warcraft, which was so rich and deep that I effectively fell out of gaming after I stopped playing because everything else felt hollow. Until Zelda BOTW. It was the first game in a decade that brought back the fun and excitement of gaming as a kid.

I work in an open office and am wondering if using music to block out sound is counterproductive I work in an open office. I like my coworkers but their little noises drive me insane. One guy whistles cheerfully all day, another guy eats all day and chews like a cow, another has severe coughing and throat clearing tics, one guy laughs like a donkey every few minutes, etc. Unfortunately, music, even instrumental music, distracts me like crazy too. I like music way too much and get lost in it. I’m aware I can wear earplugs but it’s not right for me. So I’m curious about you guys - what’s the lesser evil? Listening to music, or your noisy coworkers? EDIT - thanks for the suggestions, you guys are awesome! lo-fi and brown noise work like a charm.

Q: If you respond to this comment with "bruh" I will try using New Reddit
A: When I was programming every day, one of the things I was thankful for was having a job that allowed me to listen to music all day, not to mention the effect that music I loved would have on my mood, so there were benefits beyond just drowning out outside noise.

One technique that worked well for me was to listen to the same couple of albums over and over. While the songs had words that could otherwise be distracting, I had listened to them so many times that they effectively became white noise for me.

Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Q: >	more benefits to having karma,

Good god please no, it’s already bad enough with karma whores and gallowboobs when karma isn’t useful at all, but if it actually did stuff it would be even worse
A: I’ll take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned.

Now that I have your attention, I want to say that regardless of your opinion on open borders, let's at least agree on one fact and stop clouding the waters: the majority of the illegal immigrants living in the US came for economic opportunity, not because they were seeking asylum.  Whether or not they should be deported is debatable, but let's at least stop with the falsehood that most of them are asylum seekers.

These are **Community Awards**. # What Are the Benefits of Community Awards? Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**. With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank. Mods can access the Community Bank to give… # Mod-Exclusive Awards Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community. Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price. * Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium * Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium * … and so on! Here’s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments: &#x200B; [This example shows the coveted Golden Toaster Award, which you can view in a larger size by hovering over the icon.](https://i.redd.it/rek8d44u6bc31.png) # Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards? Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities. # Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now? Check out [our companion post on r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards! We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards: * They must comply with [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy); * They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and * They must be SFW. # A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards! We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we’re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards! Participating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!

Q: I'm betting 6 months until Reddit starts offering to let users buy karma. Now that I have your attention, I want to say that regardless of your opinion on open borders, let's at least agree on one fact and stop clouding the waters: the majority of the illegal immigrants living in the US came for economic opportunity, not because they were seeking asylum.  Whether or not they should be deported is debatable, but let's at least stop with the falsehood that most of them are asylum seekers.
A: I’ll take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned.

We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything! Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA 230”) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits. Sometimes called [“the twenty-six words that created the internet,”](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414) the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden’s efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality).

Q: Mr Huffman has the First Amendment right to support whatever content he chooses to, as does any private business. And other users have the right to choose whether or not they want to associate with a site that hosts that kind of content. 

From what I am told, The_Donald is home to messages that cross the line toward inciting the hatred that is eroding our democracy and it would be good to see Mr. Huffman and Reddit to do more work to moderate such behavior. 

on #2 - While they're not legally obligated to do anything, any American site should remove any foreign state-sponsored content, whether it is Russian bots, or Chinese deniers of the Tiananmen massacre.
A: Hello  /u/senatorwyden, I have a two part question:

1) Do You support Mr. Huffman's decision to allow subreddits such as The_Donald to continue to have a presence on the site, despite continuous sharing and posting of questionable and subversive content? Why/Why not?

2) As Reddit has grown into a huge website for discourse, do you feel that sites such as this are obligated to remove nefarious/questionable accounts (i.e. foreign-state sponsored) along with questionable content? Why/Why not?

Q: OK so lots of questions but not much, if anything in the way of answers. Let me try...I know it is a tricky road but what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles? Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?
A: >what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (née brigading) that are in alpha testing, and we’ve built a new “reliable reporter” system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

>Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with.

Q: We seem to be encroaching (if not already fully entrenched in) the tools of democracy being weaponized in a way that we haven't been up against before. The foundations of freedom on the internet are being levied to mount massive disinformation and influence campaigns. 

Despite all of that, internet freedom is still immensely important albeit extremely fragile. What are some ways we can tackle the spread of disinformation and foreign political interference while still safeguarding the free flow of speech and information. For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions? For Ron Wyden, what can we do legislatively to hold company's that don't act in good faith accountable while still not harming the freedoms of others to be innovative in their business practices?
A: >For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddit’s greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn’t news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities.

Q: Senator, do you think requiring users of online communities to "self-moderate" is appropriate in this era of disinformation, or should sites employ stricter controls to limit the spread of disinformation?

Spez, why do you refuse to take even small steps to limit disinformation, when your peers at Twitter and other social media companies are taking more active steps?
A: Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today.

Rule management on new Reddit Hey everyone, We’re excited to bring you rule management on new Reddit today! This encompasses the creation, editing, and deletion of rules, where changes will be reflected on both new and old sites. The Rules page can be accessed through your subreddit’s mod hub, under the “Rules and Regulations” section. One new feature on the Rules page will be **rule reordering** via drag-and-drop, so you no longer have to delete everything and re-add rules. If you reorder a rule on the new site, the change will be reflected on the old site, without you having to delete and re-add them. We hope this makes your life a little bit easier when making edits to rules in your community! Some things to note: * We’ve increased the maximum number of rules per community from 10 to 15. * We’ve increased the character limit of rule short names from 50 to 100. * We’ve increased the character limit of rule report reasons from 50 to 100. * Rule numbering has been added to the old site to reflect the new site. We did this to reduce the confusion of double-numbering, and the work of having to add numbers to rules. This will also maintain consistency for rules throughout Reddit’s communities, making it easier for users to understand. [The new Rules page.](https://i.redd.it/hxy9tgrz7yi21.png) [Adding a new rule.](https://i.redd.it/uxz1wu9b8yi21.png) [Editing an existing rule.](https://i.redd.it/py4iv7we8yi21.png) [Reordering rules.](https://i.redd.it/s3nvdmtj8yi21.png) [Rules page on the old site, with numbering.](https://i.redd.it/x1w5cs2n8yi21.png) Try it out and let us know if you find any wonkiness!

Reddit’s 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff) Hi all, Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018). The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties. We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests. This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions. In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old. I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions. –Steve &#x200B; edit: Thanks for the silver you cheap bastards. update: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Q: Question, a bit offtopic. What is Reddit's stance on subreddits using bots to auto-ban users for participating in certain other subs? Will any actions be taken against that, or is it allowed. 
A: We don't like it, but we haven't provided an alternative solution. They live in a grey area.

One thing we're going to make better use of is the idea of "community karma." It'll be useful for helping communities grow safely while keep trolls and abusers at bay.

Q: Hi Spez,

Copyright seems to be a big issue for many large websites, especially YouTube, and I see daily posts about YouTube acting unfairly. It looks as though Reddit's DMCA requests are increasing exponentially.
It looks at though each request at the moment is viewed manually. I'm concerned that as the rate of requests increases, this process may be automated and the human aspect of the reviewing process (e.g. Fair use) may be lost. What's in the pipeline for Reddit for this requests?
A: Presently, we're comically (and frustratingly) manual. The team the handles DMCA requests is the team that wrote the Transparency Report, and it is a LOT of work.

We're working on tooling now to automate much of the tedium, but humans will remain in the loop.

Q: Hi Steve, I'm one of the authors on the [recent CSCW paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~eshwar3/uploads/3/8/0/4/38043045/eshwar-norms-cscw2018.pdf) studying moderation and community norms on Reddit. I'm glad that our paper was useful to explain Reddit's multi-layered architecture for moderating content and the norms that develop. Look forward to going through the transparency report in detail!
A: You just outed yourself on Reddit, you brave soul!

LOVED the paper. I thought your approach of comparing models across communities to find common sentiments was really clever, and I'd love to see us incorporate that into Reddit itself.

Reddit’s 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff) Hi all, Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018). The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties. We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests. This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions. In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old. I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions. –Steve &#x200B; edit: Thanks for the silver you cheap bastards. update: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Q: How can we trust that when reddit once said:

> We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse

Clearly this promise has been broken as countless subreddits have since been banned for content legal in the US.

What makes your promise now any more believable?

Q: Maybe this is a silly question, but was there any real research done on whether the changes being made in the redesign were changes that new users actually *wanted?*  If so, how was this information gathered?  Were these changes targeted towards attracting specific demographics, for advertising or other purposes?

Thanks for answering questions, the users appreciate it
A: > Why do I have to opt-out of the redesign over and over again?

This is a hugely annoying and embarrassing bug. We believe we've fixed most of the causes, but to be certain, we've rewritten the entire system that directs traffic to the old site vs the new site to both work as expected and to be a lot faster, and that should launch soon (days, not weeks)

> And which moron came up with it anyway?

Me. We wanted to both bring new users to the new site but also give all users a choice indefinitely, which made things technically complex.

That said, we are all frustrated that we didn't do a better job here.

Q: According to the transparency report, 33 posts were blocked in Turkey in response to a request from the Turkish government (more than any other country).    
        
Were these posts blocked in Turkey for being critical of the Erdogan regime?
A: No. It was mostly porn, and I think one about drugs.

Q: >ii) Foreign Requests (Non-Emergency)
In 2018, Reddit received 28 requests for the production of user account information from foreign governmental authorities (excluding emergency requests). Reddit did not comply with any of these requests.

I noticed that the specific foreign governments are unlisted in either the posted summation above or the actual Report.

Is there a legal reason why the governments were unlisted?

Wouldn't transparency be better served by saying "X from Canada, Y from the UK, Z from Russia, and 1 from Vatican City", or something like that?
A: Good question. We're updating that as we speak.

Update: updated.

Q: If you don't make any changes, how will you deliver ROI to those investors?  Reddit is known to make a much smaller amount of annual revenue per user than are other social media platforms.
A: In the immediate future, nothing. One of the risks of raising a lot of money is that it can be disruptive to strategy and culture, so we will overcompensate by aggressively sticking to our pre-funding plan.

Down the road, it does give us flexibility to take bigger bets or try new things, but we don't have any specific plans.

Q: Just out of interest. From the perspective of a large company how difficult has/was adapting to the EU's GDPR regulation been?
A: It's not easy, but mostly because government regulations often don't factor in the technical realities of their implementations.

That said, it's easier for us than others because we don't actually have a lot of non-public data about our users.

Reddit is such a rollercoaster for me. I keep being happy then angry then sad, because of the posts and the variaty of subs that im subscribed for. Sometimes i think about quitting the ones that makes me mad, but i also think that this is just closing my eyes to reality and just wanting to see nice things idk. What you guys think?

Q: What do you think?
A: I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features.

She says there must be someone out there that doesn’t like them. She is currently working on her own answer to this question. So if you don’t mind let’s see who is right and who is sleeping on the couch. 😃

Q: They are good but after you eat so many they are not desirable anymore
A: Maybe for you, but for me, they only become more desirable.

Is there a place for coding questions where it starts really basic and the problems progress and build off each other? Basically the title. I know a lot of problems have similar solutions or principles. I'm just curious if there is a place I can go that will progressively help me learn almost like a study plan. Some times I feel like I try a problem and there is just too much context missing.

Q: What do you think?
A: I used to turn to the [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) when learning a new language. If you can do them all, I'm sure you'll find a full-time gig programming Prolog in no time.

Just want to let everyone know that no matter what problems you’re having in life it does get better. I recently went through a rough patch in my life and i was really sad about what happened but now i realized it was for the best. So i just want to let everyone know that they matter and that it does get better.

Q: What do you think?
A: Whenever I go through a rough patch, I try to remember all the rough patches I've been through already, and all the high points and happy memories in between them. Then I remind myself that every rough patch has so far eventually been followed by good times and that whatever it is, this too shall pass. And it does.

I feel like I don’t have any “real friends” and it’s bothering me I’m not sure if I’ve just been a dumbass in my whole 19 years of living but this past week I’ve taken a step back from my friendships to examine them and honestly most of them don’t feel “genuine”, if that makes sense. In particular, this one group of friends I’ve been around since high school. They will from time to time invite me over to hang out with them or when they have a party they’ll tell me to get over there, but when I’m actually there it feels a bit disingenuous. Just little interactions, if another guest at their house gives me a hug cuz we haven’t seen each other since graduation a couple of them will follow suit. which feels extremely forced considering they don’t normally do that and I see them way more often than the guest in particular. That coupled with the fact that it doesn’t rlly feel like anybody wants to make plans with me on the off chance I ask because I assume they are my friends. It also seems like the friends I made in college are the same way, where they originally sounded like they wanted to meet up this summer, whenever I actually talk serious about it nobody wants to say when they’re free. It just makes me feel like perhaps I’m just somebody nobody really wants to be around.

Q: What do you think?
A: I think I read this on r/wholesomememes a while ago, but it's stuck with me:

*The secret to having good friends is to be a good friend.*

You can't control their feelings and actions towards you, but you can control your feelings and actions towards them. If you make the effort, give them a call, plan things, invite them, I suspect you'll find what you're looking for, whether clarity or friendship.

Will I get stuck if I accept this first job opportunity? My internship seems to be leading into an offer for full-time after graduation. I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing, but I'm nervous about just accepting the first opportunity that comes my way. Will I get stuck and have fewer opportunities if I just accept this first job? I know this question is vague, but I appreciate any advice you have for me.

Q: What if op is interning at Reddit?
A: >I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing

It's hard to find this, so I'd give strong consideration to staying.

And what does it mean to be stuck? You'd only be stuck if this was the only job available, and if this is the only job available, you have no options anyway.

Spez pls

Q: The first time you up/downvote a specific user, it's supposedly worth +1 (or very close to it). But for every time after that, the value goes down, so your second up/downvote of that same specific person might be worth .75+, and .5+ after that, etc.
A: Wait how does the karma system work then?

[CHAT] The CEO of Reddit likes us! [Steve Huffman likes r/CrossStitch](https://qz.com/1656145/reddit-ceo-steve-huffmans-favorite-subreddits/) &#x200B; Aww, that's so nice of him.

Q: This makes me want to make a cross stitch of his face. But, specifically, an endearingly shitty one.
A: I actually felt really bad about saying "shitty little things" but I'm happy it was heard with the spirit it was intended. I love the shitty ones.

In subreddit: BarefootRunning

Can barefoot running cause you to develop arches? I'm in my 40's and as long as I remember, I've had flat wide feet. Like a cartoon duck. I'm hardly an athlete, but this summer I've been working at barefoot running on grass and I'm proud to say I can now run a continuous 22 mins and cover 3.5 KM. Today while walking on the driveway I noticed that I seem to have a small arch. I inspected my feet and realized they look slightly different than I remember them, but this could be my imagination. I'm wondering if this is something others have observed. Does barefoot running "fix" or help with flat-footedness? Edit - thanks for all the feedback everyone!

Q: What do you think?
A: To echo many people here, yes, that’s been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. 

Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). 

I find that simply walking is not enough. It’s running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits.

In subreddit: NintendoSwitch

I'm a 'grown ass man'. I am getting a switch on Friday and its like reliving my childhood. Hi all, just wanted to share something that might make some of you smile. Would be fun to hear if you have had a similar experience. I’m 32. I have been gaming avidly for over 25 years, PC gamer and not had a console for over a decade. I’m a fully adult human. I have a mortgage. It’s my birthday on Friday and I am buying myself a switch. I cannot believe the level of excitement and impatience I am feeling. I feel like every minute is an hour, I keep imagining various terrible scenarios which result in me not getting the switch on Friday – it breaks, the TV doesn’t work, Friday just DOESN’T arrive. I am constantly watching youtube videos, planning exactly what I will do when I get it – what order I will get digital games in, what Nintendo online membership I will get. Made an online account weeks ago… This will be the longest work week of all time. I was thinking ‘I actually can’t remember ever feeling this level of anticipation’, then I remembered I had – as a child on those Christmas mornings getting the NES, SNES, PlayStation. The whole anticipation is bringing back so many happy memories of gaming as a child: watching my brother beating the final boss of Mario World on the SNES; playing chucky egg and grannies garden on the BBC Micro (anyone remember those?). There is something about the word ‘Nintendo that just takes me back to another time and conjures a boyish excitement in me. I am therefore doing everything possible to both heighten this excitement and increase the torture. The great irony is that I already have my switch and the games and accessories. I am a ‘grown ass man’, I have bought this with my own money and could open it any time I wish. No one would care. Instead I am forcing myself to wait until my birthday. I have even made a wee pile of the switch and everything else I have bought in a prominent place in the living room where it can torture and tantalise me. I am speaking to all my colleagues in work who have switches. Never off this reddit. My girlfriend finds this extremely amusing and is ribbing me mercilessly about it, which is part of the fun. There is so much negative reporting about gaming in the media so I wanted to share how much I am enjoying the sense of pure fun, joy, and excitement. I feel sorry for people who don’t know how rewarding gaming can be. This Friday morning – I am opening my switch in my dressing gown at 7am like its Christmas morning 1997. Christmas f'ing morning for a 32 year-old, slightly greying, small child.

Q: This is how i felt whe buying the switch. Im 27 and have been gaming since i was really young. Ive jad a faming pc for over 8 years and buying the switch and playing zelda breath of the wild made me relive moments i had when i was a younger me playing ocarina of time.
A: Video games were a huge part of growing up for me until World of Warcraft, which was so rich and deep that I effectively fell out of gaming after I stopped playing because everything else felt hollow. Until Zelda BOTW. It was the first game in a decade that brought back the fun and excitement of gaming as a kid.

I work in an open office and am wondering if using music to block out sound is counterproductive I work in an open office. I like my coworkers but their little noises drive me insane. One guy whistles cheerfully all day, another guy eats all day and chews like a cow, another has severe coughing and throat clearing tics, one guy laughs like a donkey every few minutes, etc. Unfortunately, music, even instrumental music, distracts me like crazy too. I like music way too much and get lost in it. I’m aware I can wear earplugs but it’s not right for me. So I’m curious about you guys - what’s the lesser evil? Listening to music, or your noisy coworkers? EDIT - thanks for the suggestions, you guys are awesome! lo-fi and brown noise work like a charm.

Q: If you respond to this comment with "bruh" I will try using New Reddit
A: When I was programming every day, one of the things I was thankful for was having a job that allowed me to listen to music all day, not to mention the effect that music I loved would have on my mood, so there were benefits beyond just drowning out outside noise.

One technique that worked well for me was to listen to the same couple of albums over and over. While the songs had words that could otherwise be distracting, I had listened to them so many times that they effectively became white noise for me.

A: I'd be supportive of once a year or so. We can technically do it now, but I think there are bunch of little edge cases we'd need to explore before making it real. It could be an interesting Premium/Gold feature to allow it more often.

Thanks to all who participated! Hi all, You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks. As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities. # What Are Community Awards? Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins. Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price. * Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium * Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium * … and so on!

Q: >	more benefits to having karma,

Good god please no, it’s already bad enough with karma whores and gallowboobs when karma isn’t useful at all, but if it actually did stuff it would be even worse
A: I’ll take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned.

Now that I have your attention, I want to say that regardless of your opinion on open borders, let's at least agree on one fact and stop clouding the waters: the majority of the illegal immigrants living in the US came for economic opportunity, not because they were seeking asylum.

We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything! Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA 230”) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits. Sometimes called [“the twenty-six words that created the internet,”](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414) the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden’s efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality). Proof: https://i.redd.it/jbtpca0xnk131.jpg

Q: Mr Huffman has the First Amendment right to support whatever content he chooses to, as does any private business. And other users have the right to choose whether or not they want to associate with a site that hosts that kind of content. 

From what I am told, The_Donald is home to messages that cross the line toward inciting the hatred that is eroding our democracy and it would be good to see Mr. Huffman and Reddit to do more work to moderate such behavior. 

on #2 - While they're not legally obligated to do anything, any American site should remove any foreign state-sponsored content, whether it is Russian bots, or Chinese deniers of the Tiananmen massacre.
A: Hello  /u/senatorwyden, I have a two part question:

1) Do You support Mr. Huffman's decision to allow subreddits such as The_Donald to continue to have a presence on the site, despite continuous sharing and posting of questionable and subversive content? Why/Why not?

We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything! Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA 230”) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits. Sometimes called [“the twenty-six words that created the internet,”](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414) the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden’s efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality).

Q: OK so lots of questions but not much, if anything in the way of answers. Let me try...I know it is a tricky road but what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles? Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?
A: >what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (née brigading) that are in alpha testing, and we’ve built a new “reliable reporter” system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

>Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with.

Q: We seem to be encroaching (if not already fully entrenched in) the tools of democracy being weaponized in a way that we haven't been up against before. The foundations of freedom on the internet are being levied to mount massive disinformation and influence campaigns. 

Despite all of that, internet freedom is still immensely important albeit extremely fragile. What are some ways we can tackle the spread of disinformation and foreign political interference while still safeguarding the free flow of speech and information. For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions? For Ron Wyden, what can we do legislatively to hold company's that don't act in good faith accountable while still not harming the freedoms of others to be innovative in their business practices?
A: >For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddit’s greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn’t news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities.

Q: Senator, do you think requiring users of online communities to "self-moderate" is appropriate in this era of disinformation, or should sites employ stricter controls to limit the spread of disinformation?

Spez, why do you refuse to take even small steps to limit disinformation, when your peers at Twitter and other social media companies are taking more active steps?
A: Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today.

Reddit is such a rollercoaster for me. I keep being happy then angry then sad, because of the posts and the variaty of subs that im subscribed for. Sometimes i think about quitting the ones that makes me mad, but i also think that this is just closing my eyes to reality and just wanting to see nice things idk. What you guys think?

Q: What do you think?
A: I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features.

I feel like I don’t have any “real friends” and it’s bothering me I’m not sure if I’ve just been a dumbass in my whole 19 years of living but this past week I’ve taken a step back from my friendships to examine them and honestly most of them don’t feel “genuine”, if that makes sense. In particular, this one group of friends I’ve been around since high school. They will from time to time invite me over to hang out with them or when they have a party they’ll tell me to get over there, but when I’m actually there it feels a bit disingenuous. Just little interactions, if another guest at their house gives me a hug cuz we haven’t seen each other since graduation a couple of them will follow suit. which feels extremely forced considering they don’t normally do that and I see them way more often than the guest in particular. That coupled with the fact that it doesn’t rlly feel like anybody wants to make plans with me on the off chance I ask because I assume they are my friends. It also seems like the friends I made in college are the same way, where they originally sounded like they wanted to meet up this summer, whenever I actually talk serious about it nobody wants to say when they’re free. It just makes me feel like perhaps I’m just somebody nobody really wants to be around.

Q: What do you think?
A: I think I read this on r/wholesomememes a while ago, but it's stuck with me:

*The secret to having good friends is to be a good friend.*

You can't control their feelings and actions towards you, but you can control your feelings and actions towards them. If you make the effort, give them a call, plan things, invite them, I suspect you'll find what you're looking for, whether clarity or friendship.

In subreddit: BarefootRunning

Can barefoot running cause you to develop arches? I'm in my 40's and as long as I remember, I've had flat wide feet. Like a cartoon duck. I'm hardly an athlete, but this summer I've been working at barefoot running on grass and I'm proud to say I can now run a continuous 22 mins and cover 3.5 KM. Today while walking on the driveway I noticed that I seem to have a small arch. I inspected my feet and realized they look slightly different than I remember them, but this could be my imagination. I'm wondering if this is something others have observed. Does barefoot running "fix" or help with flat-footedness? Edit - thanks for all the feedback everyone!

Q: What do you think?
A: To echo many people here, yes, that’s been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. 

Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). 

I find that simply walking is not enough. It’s running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits.

In subreddit: NintendoSwitch

I'm a 'grown ass man'. I am getting a switch on Friday and its like reliving my childhood. Hi all, just wanted to share something that might make some of you smile. Would be fun to hear if you have had a similar experience. I’m 32. I have been gaming avidly for over 25 years, PC gamer and not had a console for over a decade. I’m a fully adult human. I have a mortgage. It’s my birthday on Friday and I am buying myself a switch. I cannot believe the level of excitement and impatience I am feeling. I feel like every minute is an hour, I keep imagining various terrible scenarios which result in me not getting the switch on Friday – it breaks, the TV doesn’t work, Friday just DOESN’T arrive. I am constantly watching youtube videos, planning exactly what I will do when I get it – what order I will get digital games in, what Nintendo online membership I will get. Made an online account weeks ago… This will be the longest work week of all time. I was thinking ‘I actually can’t remember ever feeling this level of anticipation’, then I remembered I had – as a child on those Christmas mornings getting the NES, SNES, PlayStation. The whole anticipation is bringing back so many happy memories of gaming as a child: watching my brother beating the final boss of Mario World on the SNES; playing chucky egg and grannies garden on the BBC Micro (anyone remember those?). There is something about the word ‘Nintendo that just takes me back to another time and conjures a boyish excitement in me. I am therefore doing everything possible to both heighten this excitement and increase the torture. The great irony is that I already have my switch and the games and accessories. I am a ‘grown ass man’, I have bought this with my own money and could open it any time I wish. No one would care. Instead I am forcing myself to wait until my birthday. I have even made a wee pile of the switch and everything else I have bought in a prominent place in the living room where it can torture and tantalise me. I am speaking to all my colleagues in work who have switches. Never off this reddit. My girlfriend finds this extremely amusing and is ribbing me mercilessly about it, which is part of the fun. There is so much negative reporting about gaming in the media so I wanted to share how much I am enjoying the sense of pure fun, joy, and excitement. I feel sorry for people who don’t know how rewarding gaming can be. This Friday morning – I am opening my switch in my dressing gown at 7am like its Christmas morning 1997. Christmas f'ing morning for a 32 year-old, slightly greying, small child.

Q: This is how i felt whe buying the switch. Im 27 and have been gaming since i was really young. Ive jad a faming pc for over 8 years and buying the switch and playing zelda breath of the wild made me relive moments i had when i was a younger me playing ocarina of time.
A: Video games were a huge part of growing up for me until World of Warcraft, which was so rich and deep that I effectively fell out of gaming after I stopped playing because everything else felt hollow. Until Zelda BOTW. It was the first game in a decade that brought back the fun and excitement of gaming as a kid.

Introducing Community Awards! **UPDATE (9/4):** Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been [announced below in the stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)! Thanks to all who participated! Hi all, You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks. As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities. # What Are Community Awards? Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins. Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide). [A highly decorated post on r\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://i.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png) In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**. # What Are the Benefits of Community Awards? Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**. With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

Q: >	more benefits to having karma,

Good god please no, it’s already bad enough with karma whores and gallowboobs when karma isn’t useful at all, but if it actually did stuff it would be even worse
A: I’ll take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned.

Introducing Community Awards! **UPDATE (9/4):** Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been [announced below in the stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)! Thanks to all who participated! Hi all, You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks. As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities. # What Are Community Awards? Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins. Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**. With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins.

A: Community Awards give Coins back to the Community. Mods can use those Coins to give out Mod Awards (and months of Premium). Silver doesn't do that.

Our hope is that this is a fun feature that brings mods / users together, and creates another way to customize Communities.

We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything! Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA 230”) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits. Sometimes called [“the twenty-six words that created the internet,”](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414) the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden’s efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality). Proof: https://i.redd.it/jbtpca0xnk131.jpg

Q: Mr Huffman has the First Amendment right to support whatever content he chooses to, as does any private business. And other users have the right to choose whether or not they want to associate with a site that hosts that kind of content. 

From what I am told, The_Donald is home to messages that cross the line toward inciting the hatred that is eroding our democracy and it would be good to see Mr. Huffman and Reddit to do more work to moderate such behavior. 

on #2 - While they're not legally obligated to do anything, any American site should remove any foreign state-sponsored content, whether it is Russian bots, or Chinese deniers of the Tiananmen massacre.
A: Hello  /u/senatorwyden, I have a two part question:

1) Do You support Mr. Huffman's decision to allow subreddits such as The_Donald to continue to have a presence on the site, despite continuous sharing and posting of questionable and subversive content? Why/Why not?

2) As Reddit has grown into a huge website for discourse, do you feel that sites such as this are obligated to remove nefarious/questionable accounts (i.e. foreign-state sponsored) along with questionable content? Why/Why not?

Q: OK so lots of questions but not much, if anything in the way of answers. Let me try...I know it is a tricky road but what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles? Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?
A: >what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (née brigading) that are in alpha testing, and we’ve built a new “reliable reporter” system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

>Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with.

Q: We seem to be encroaching (if not already fully entrenched in) the tools of democracy being weaponized in a way that we haven't been up against before. The foundations of freedom on the internet are being levied to mount massive disinformation and influence campaigns. 

Despite all of that, internet freedom is still immensely important albeit extremely fragile. What are some ways we can tackle the spread of disinformation and foreign political interference while still safeguarding the free flow of speech and information. For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions? For Ron Wyden, what can we do legislatively to hold company's that don't act in good faith accountable while still not harming the freedoms of others to be innovative in their business practices?
A: >For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddit’s greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn’t news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities.

Q: Senator, do you think requiring users of online communities to "self-moderate" is appropriate in this era of disinformation, or should sites employ stricter controls to limit the spread of disinformation?

Spez, why do you refuse to take even small steps to limit disinformation, when your peers at Twitter and other social media companies are taking more active steps?
A: Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we’ve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we’ve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today.

Rule management on new Reddit Hey everyone, We’re excited to bring you rule management on new Reddit today! This encompasses the creation, editing, and deletion of rules, where changes will be reflected on both new and old sites. The Rules page can be accessed through your subreddit’s mod hub, under the “Rules and Regulations” section. One new feature on the Rules page will be **rule reordering** via drag-and-drop, so you no longer have to delete everything and re-add rules. If you reorder a rule on the new site, the change will be reflected on the old site, without you having to delete and re-add them. We hope this makes your life a little bit easier when making edits to rules in your community! Some things to note: * We’ve increased the maximum number of rules per community from 10 to 15. * We’ve increased the character limit of rule short names from 50 to 100. * We’ve increased the character limit of rule report reasons from 50 to 100. * Rule numbering has been added to the old site to reflect the new site. We did this to reduce the confusion of double-numbering, and the work of having to add numbers to rules. This will also maintain consistency for rules throughout Reddit’s communities, making it easier for users to understand. [The new Rules page.](https://i.redd.it/hxy9tgrz7yi21.png) [Adding a new rule.](https://i.redd.it/uxz1wu9b8yi21.png) [Editing an existing rule.](https://i.redd.it/py4iv7we8yi21.png) [Reordering rules.](https://i.redd.it/s3nvdmtj8yi21.png) [Rules page on the old site, with numbering.](https://i.redd.it/x1w5cs2n8yi21.png) Try it out and let us know if you find any wonkiness!

Reddit’s 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff) Hi all, Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018). The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties. We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests. This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions. In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old. I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions. –Steve &#x200B; edit: Thanks for the silver you cheap bastards. update: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Q: u/spez, what's the status on title editing that I asked you about last year?
A: Well... ummm... you see... it's been busy around here. Honestly, I'd still love to do it (with limitations), but we just haven't gotten around to it.

In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests. This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions. In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old. I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions. –Steve &#x200B; edit: Thanks for the silver you cheap bastards. update: I'm out for now. Will check back later.

Q: Question, a bit offtopic. What is Reddit's stance on subreddits using bots to auto-ban users for participating in certain other subs? Will any actions be taken against that, or is it allowed. 
A: We don't like it, but we haven't provided an alternative solution. They live in a grey area.

One thing we're going to make better use of is the idea of "community karma." It'll be useful for helping communities grow safely while keep trolls and abusers at bay.

Q: You said you received 1 request to remove content from a governmental entity in the United States. Can you be a bit more specific as to what topic this request was concerned with? I try to understand what content might warrant this outlier.
A: We've given as much information in the report as we can give you (but we rejected the request).

Q: Hi Spez,

Copyright seems to be a big issue for many large websites, especially YouTube, and I see daily posts about YouTube acting unfairly. It looks as though Reddit's DMCA requests are increasing exponentially.
It looks at though each request at the moment is viewed manually. I'm concerned that as the rate of requests increases, this process may be automated and the human aspect of the reviewing process (e.g. Fair use) may be lost. What's in the pipeline for Reddit for this requests?
A: Presently, we're comically (and frustratingly) manual. The team the handles DMCA requests is the team that wrote the Transparency Report, and it is a LOT of work.

We're working on tooling now to automate much of the tedium, but humans will remain in the loop.

Q: Hi Steve, I'm one of the authors on the [recent CSCW paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~eshwar3/uploads/3/8/0/4/38043045/eshwar-norms-cscw2018.pdf) studying moderation and community norms on Reddit. I'm glad that our paper was useful to explain Reddit's multi-layered architecture for moderating content and the norms that develop. Look forward to going through the transparency report in detail!
A: You just outed yourself on Reddit, you brave soul!

LOVED the paper. I thought your approach of comparing models across communities to find common sentiments was really clever, and I'd love to see us incorporate that into Reddit itself.

Q: How can we trust that when reddit once said:

> We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse

Clearly this promise has been broken as countless subreddits have since been banned for content legal in the US.

What makes your promise now any more believable?

Q: Maybe this is a silly question, but was there any real research done on whether the changes being made in the redesign were changes that new users actually *wanted?*  If so, how was this information gathered?  Were these changes targeted towards attracting specific demographics, for advertising or other purposes?

Thanks for answering questions, the users appreciate it
A: > Why do I have to opt-out of the redesign over and over again?

This is a hugely annoying and embarrassing bug. We believe we've fixed most of the causes, but to be certain, we've rewritten the entire system that directs traffic to the old site vs the new site to both work as expected and to be a lot faster, and that should launch soon (days, not weeks)

> And which moron came up with it anyway?

Me. We wanted to both bring new users to the new site but also give all users a choice indefinitely, which made things technically complex.

That said, we are all frustrated that we didn't do a better job here.

Q: According to the transparency report, 33 posts were blocked in Turkey in response to a request from the Turkish government (more than any other country).    
        
Were these posts blocked in Turkey for being critical of the Erdogan regime?
A: No. It was mostly porn, and I think one about drugs.

Q: >ii) Foreign Requests (Non-Emergency)
In 2018, Reddit received 28 requests for the production of user account information from foreign governmental authorities (excluding emergency requests). Reddit did not comply with any of these requests.

I noticed that the specific foreign governments are unlisted in either the posted summation above or the actual Report.

Is there a legal reason why the governments were unlisted?

Wouldn't transparency be better served by saying "X from Canada, Y from the UK, Z from Russia, and 1 from Vatican City", or something like that?
A: Good question. We're updating that as we speak.

Update: updated.

Q: If you don't make any changes, how will you deliver ROI to those investors?  Reddit is known to make a much smaller amount of annual revenue per user than are other social media platforms.
A: In the immediate future, nothing. One of the risks of raising a lot of money is that it can be disruptive to strategy and culture, so we will overcompensate by aggressively sticking to our pre-funding plan.

Down the road, it does give us flexibility to take bigger bets or try new things, but we don't have any specific plans.

Q: Just out of interest. From the perspective of a large company how difficult has/was adapting to the EU's GDPR regulation been?
A: It's not easy, but mostly because government regulations often don't factor in the technical realities of their implementations.

That said, it's easier for us than others because we don't actually have a lot of non-public data about our users.

Q: What are you planning to do with the money you’ve recently raised? Besides keeping Reddit running I assume, are there any specific goals in using it?
A: In the immediate future, nothing. One of the risks of raising a lot of money is that it can be disruptive to strategy and culture, so we will overcompensate by aggressively sticking to our pre-funding plan.

Down the road, it does give us flexibility to take bigger bets or try new things, but we don't have any specific plans.

Q: Hi Steve. What do you have to say to the members of the Reddit community who have expressed concerns about Reddit taking on Tencent as an investor?
A: It's a fair question to ask. Tencent is a global investor who have invested in many [successful internet companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent#2011%E2%80%932014:_Early_investments).

Our governance didn't change during this round, which means we didn't add anyone to the board, and our policies won't be changing either.

Do downvotes make Reddit better? Downvoting abusive, off topic, or inaccurate posts improves the quality of the content, but anecdotally I observe that downvotes to seem to be used to indicate disagreement overwhelmingly more often. So what this ends up doing, as I’m sure anyone here has already thought about, is disincentivizing minority opinions, and also longer more thoughtful comments in general as well as sincerity in general as opposed to sarcasm. Anecdotally, what I experience is that downvotes make Reddit seem toxic and unpleasant and incentivize brief sarcastic exchanges which are also toxic and unpleasant. What do you think? E: the opinion seems overwhelmingly that it’s bad. Interesting that the feature exists. There must be a reason.

Q: What do you think?
A: A couple years ago, I was wondering this exact question.

Ups and downs are something we've had since *nearly* the first version of Reddit (but not the very first version: early iterations had words instead of arrows, but words were too subjective and restrictive).

Anyway... a couple years ago I considered the idea that downvotes were purely destructive, and that we'd be better off without them. My reasoning was that it feels bad to receive downvotes, and getting downvoted is an especially poor experience if you're a new user. If our goal is to make Reddit more welcoming and accessible, we were working against ourselves. Also, downvotes are weaponized by users and communities to harass and brigade, further compounding the problem.

However, despite their flaws, downvotes are a critical tool for communities to develop and maintain their voice, and without them we couldn't scale moderation. There are only so many moderators and far fewer admins, and by allowing community members to moderate content in a lightweight way, they can develop their own identities and voice and keep out the junk (most of it at least).

I know downvotes have their flaws, but they've been critical to growth of every large subreddit, making addressing their flaws supremely important. Improving downvotes is one of our current initiatives, and hopefully you'll feel the changes in the coming weeks if you haven't felt them already.

An actual fix for the scrolling performance issue on the Lightbox scroller on macOS Safari I made a post a month ago saying I found a fix and it got over 200 upvotes, but the post ended up being confusing because I was mistaken in what I thought the problem was. I can see that it hasn't been fixed still. However, I actually found a fix after taking another look. When you open a post, the #overlayScrollContainer element receives focus, presumably for accessibility reasons. For whatever reason, this element having focus causes the lag (20 fps scrolling). If you click anywhere on the container once it's open, the performance issue vanishes until you close it and reopen another post. Something to do with focus is causing the issue. [I notice that there's another inner div also with `tabindex="-1"` within the scrollable container.](https://i.gyazo.com/2e671e874ab51e2716a7cb752b8ba74f.png). **If you give the focus to this inner element instead of the parent scroller, there is no performance issue.** (Scrolling becomes 60 fps). I assume there is no problem with accessibility here because the Lightbox scroller is still in focus, it's just the direct child of the element with the overflow-y rule. Here's some code you can paste in the console while navigating between posts. setInterval(() => { const scroller = document.querySelector('#overlayScrollContainer') if (scroller) { console.log('Applying scrolling fix') scroller.firstElementChild.focus() } }, 10000) // <-- 10 seconds; change to any number in ms Hopefully this actually solves the issue now and Safari scrolling can finally be fixed!

Q: What do you think?
A: Well this is a nice surprise. Works for me.

r/politics Fall 2018 Meta Thread - Rule changes for submission titles, article subtitles, rehosted content and more Greetings denizens of r/politics. It has been a while since we've posted a meta-thread, and we have a few things to discuss. Please for our collective sanity - yours and ours - read everything within before jumping into the comments. ###Rule change - Submissions titles, article subtitles and articles with no headline In September of 2016, r/politics moved to an 'Exact headline only' rule, after several months of discussion among the moderators, and across meta threads between April to August. In order to make enforcement of the new 'exact headline' rule possible, a bot service was created to match headlines to the articles... which was turned off shortly thereafter due to an unsustainable false positive rate. The mod team discovered that the headline metadata across many sites was simply too inconsitent to enforce with automation effectively - some sites left their organization name in, some had a page title separate from the headline, some had malformed titles or no headline data at all. So we moved to manual enforcement of the rule. Overall, the mod team believes that the state of r/politics titles is more consistent, and less likely to mislead readers than the previous title rules. But it has remained extremely rigid and strict as a carry-over from when the rule was written to accommodate our bot service - which we never managed to get running the way we had intended. We're often missing additional information and context from the article subhead or subtitle. We're also handicapping websites that use an artistic or short primary headline, in favor of more descriptive subheads. So, starting today we are making the following changes **Subtitles are now allowed in submission titles** The title rule will now be updated as follows: >Submissions must have titles comprised of the exact copied and pasted headline from the article, and may use the subtitle / subhead at your discretion. Do not include the organization name, extraneous quotes, or the article section.

For a long time, we have tried to actively remove articles which were overly reliant on content taken from other sources - block quotes, video clips, transcripts etc. The intent was to steer users to the original source for stories, and as a side effect, increase the story diversity on our front page. However this has long been one of our hardest rules to enforce - it can go hours before being detected, and there are a plethora of grey areas and uncertainties that moderators have encountered while trying to keep enforcement consistent. After review of 2 months worth of our "front page" removals which totaled 462, 144 of them were for removed for "rehosted content", making up 31% of those removals. It was second only to "Off-Topic" removals which totaled 261. 21 of the "rehosted content" removals made it to #1, so to put it in perspective we pulled (at least for those two months) 10 #1 submissions for rehosting each month. **Our new rule for "Rehosted Content" will read as follows:** >No copy-pasted articles >Please do not submit articles or videos that are a direct, complete copy-paste of original reporting. Articles or videos that add another take on a subject, or include different verbiage or context are allowed. There was a lot of debate about this one. On one hand, it may lead to more similar content on the subreddit or the front page in cases where Megathreads are not applicable. However, we will also be removing less content which will make for a more user-friendly experience as we generally want to remove the least content that we can from users. We want to watch the impact of this change carefully to see how it performs, and would like to get your feedback on how the rule may change your experience reading r/politics. _______ The two above changes will be the focus of this meta-thread, but we expect there will be a lot of other things to discuss. Below is a brief Q&A, which will link to some top level comments below for longer discussion threads. If you could help us keep the thread organized by discussion area, it would be appreciated. ###Q&A **Q**: *What is the current policy on brand new users to r/politics?* If you were reading carefully, you may have noticed a message in our bot sticky message letting the community know that users with less than 100 karma were being temporarily muted as a trial to see if it resulted in less trolling and malicious behavior. After conducting an analysis, we determined that we weren't happy with the effectiveness of that rule and have since made it much less aggressive. We know there were a couple of users lobbying to try this approach - we found that the rate of false positives was simply too high. In a random sample of collected removals, we found that as many as 70% of removed comments were non-rule breaking, which was far out of line with our intended result. After looking at the results, we are now much more confident that positive karma simply is not a good predicator of good behavior. That said, we did increase the aggressiveness of our negative karma gate mute rules, which remain in effect as of now. We're still discussing if the false positive rate of removals for those conditions is acceptable. We may have more indepth discussion below. **Q**: *There are websites on the domain whitelist that I don't think should be there. Why can't we remove them?* **A**: In August of 2017 we moved from a domain blacklist - which targetted rule breaking domains - to a domain whitelist - that approved generally rule compliant domains. At that time, we were very sensitive to the impact of making this change, and were determined to make certain that the whitelist was not a round-about way of trying to curate our front page, or push submissions in a different ideological direction than what users were interested in submitting. To guide us, we created a 'domain notability' requirement, which would ensure that any domain that was sufficiently influential or remarkable would be permitted. A year and a half later, we're extremely happy with the impact of the whitelist system. It has *dramatically* reduced the amount of spam and obvious rule breaking content that we have submitted to us. Things that were once incredibly commonplace - advertising spam, Macedonian fake news / click-bait websites, blogs, Youtube promoters etc - are now made instantly irrelevant. This has made r/politics/new much easier to browse, and has let the moderator team focus our efforts elsewhere - on enforcing comment guidelines, removing trolls, removing off topic content etc etc. There are many domains that we receive regular complaints about - their content may be inflammatory, controversial, or spurious. The fact is that we were very actively trying *not* to target those domains when moving to this system. We want to make user voting - the core mechanic that all of reddit is based around - the primary method of curation on our page. We still feel confident that our approach is sound - but of course we will discuss further below. Please (for the love of all that is holy) try to remember - inclusion on the whitelist is **not** an endorsement by the mod team or r/politics, or a reflection of reputability. Is is *solely* reflective of whether the domain is *notable*. **Q**: *I'm unclear or unhappy with the comment rules. What kinds of comments do you remove?* **A**: You can read all the [comment rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil). First and foremost however - please never under any circumstance make any comment which wishes physical harm on anyone for any reason. And I know it's troubling on a couple levels that we have to now specify this: * Quoting people suggesting physical harm as a way to make the same implication is not a neat trick for evading this rule. Do not use direct quotes in order to imply or condone physical harm. * Do not make 'suggestions' for capital executions unless we've entered the sentencing phase for an active trial in which that may be relevant. Beyond comments that incite, condone or wish harm, we aggressively prune comments that are uncivil towards others, or are intended to troll or flame other users. Comments of this nature could be removed from the thread, and repetitive behaviour of this nature may result in a ban from the subreddit. ______ ###We would like your feedback! **Midterms** Midterms are always a very busy time for the subreddit! This year, as you may have noticed, we did something interesting by having individual threads for each state, a stickied thread linking to those threads, and an overarching megathread for general discussion. We would like to know what you did or did not like about the format, what could be improved, what could we do differently? **Themed threads** Our current "themed" threads are scheduled as follows: Sunday - Satire Sunday * This thread is intended for users to be able to post things that fall under our general "no satire" rule. Clips from satirical shows like SNL, or articles from sites like The Onion. Monday - What happened in your state? * This thread is intended for users to post political stories of interest in their respective states. Friday - Fun Friday * This is a thread to just decompress and have fun! Saturday - Political Cartoon thread * As the name suggests, this is a thread to share political cartoons. We would like to know, do you enjoy these threads? Do you have suggestions for other interesting threads? **Chat** Reddit recently added a chat feature for communities. Our own community chat has grown to over 13,000 subscribers! Anyone is welcome to join and participate. If you're subscribed to r/politics, it should show up in your recommendations. It will also show up on the sidebar of the redesigned site. Chat has the same conduct rules as the subreddit. We've taken on a handful of chat-only moderators to help keep the chat friendly and open. Huge shoutout to the help we've been getting from our chat moderators - along with a large number of incredible new mod team volunteers we've added to our subreddit team. Since chat is so new, we're still figuring out how it should be run - it is very much a new experiment for us. We'd love to hear your ideas and feedback on how we can make the chat experience useful and fun for our users!

Q: >what do you think about a feature to sync headlines

That'd be fantastic, spez! ETA?
A: This is great. There are some really good ideas in here that we might be able to make easier for you.

For example, what do you think about a feature to sync headlines (maybe automatically, or automatically add a flair and allowing a mod to edit?). This has always been complicated for a variety of reasons (title shenanigans on Reddit, and inconsistent publishers), but I think your specific use-case might be a good one to work with to make things easier, whether fancy tech or manual mod editing.

In subreddit: politics

r/politics Fall 2018 Meta Thread - Rule changes for submission titles, article subtitles, rehosted content and more Greetings denizens of r/politics. It has been a while since we've posted a meta-thread, and we have a few things to discuss. Please for our collective sanity - yours and ours - read everything within before jumping into the comments. ###Rule change - Submissions titles, article subtitles and articles with no headline In September of 2016, r/politics moved to an 'Exact headline only' rule, after several months of discussion among the moderators, and across meta threads between April to August. In order to make enforcement of the new 'exact headline' rule possible, a bot service was created to match headlines to the articles... which was turned off shortly thereafter due to an unsustainable false positive rate. The mod team discovered that the headline metadata across many sites was simply too inconsitent to enforce with automation effectively - some sites left their organization name in, some had a page title separate from the headline, some had malformed titles or no headline data at all. So we moved to manual enforcement of the rule. Overall, the mod team believes that the state of r/politics titles is more consistent, and less likely to mislead readers than the previous title rules. But it has remained extremely rigid and strict as a carry-over from when the rule was written to accommodate our bot service - which we never managed to get running the way we had intended. We're often missing additional information and context from the article subhead or subtitle. We're also handicapping websites that use an artistic or short primary headline, in favor of more descriptive subheads. So, starting today we are making the following changes **Subtitles are now allowed in submission titles** The title rule will now be updated as follows: >Submissions must have titles comprised of the exact copied and pasted headline from the article, and may use the subtitle / subhead at your discretion. Do not include the organization name, extraneous quotes, or the article section. Do not add, remove or change words from either the title or subtitle - with the following required changes: > * If the headline AND subtitle/subhead *together* exceed the character limit for reddit titles, you may only use the primary headline. > * It is strongly suggested that subtitles or subheads should be marked by separating it from the headline using a dash (`-`), vertical bar (`|`), semicolon (`;`) or other appropriate non-attention seeking punctuation character. Any punctuation that could alter the meaning of the title will be treated as rule breaking. **Articles without any headline at all will use a structured title format** In cases where a web page has no headline whatsoever, a structure following the rules below must be used. >In rare cases where you wish to submit a link and the content is acceptable for r/politics, but there is no headline on the page, you must use the following style for the submission title: > `Publishing organization, body or group`, `published date`, `Title of document or page` > Examples of this style in practice: > * [Department of Justice, 2018-7-13, Case 1:18-cr-00215-ABJ](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) > * [FiveThirtyEight, 2018-10-19, 2018 Senate Forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/?ex_cid=midterms-header) > * [State of Alabama, 2017-12-12, 2017 Official General Election Results](https://sos.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/voter-pdfs/2017%20Official%20General%20Election%20Results%20without%20Write-In%20Appendix%20-%202017-12-28.pdf) ###Rehosted content Another change we are implementing is a change to our "rehosting" rule.

Q: I find it kind of weird, you know, that you’re responding to this comment in a thread which criticizes you heavily for ignoring some major issues.

It seems clear to me the commentator you respond to is saying he can’t wait for your live AMA because you won’t be able to ignore the obvious /r/t_d questions you are here and in your earlier AMA.

So your comment here, while innocent on a surface level... sort of feels a little taunting, you know? And that worries me.

Because you’re either intentionally taunting users... or you’re just a little tone deaf on how to communicate with the userbase.

Ultimately I love Reddit, despite the shortcomings and current issues it faces... but this sort of behavior worries me a little bit. I’m looking forward to seeing what you bring to the table in the future, though. I’m optimistic for the future of this corner of the internet.

You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA. Update: I've got to take off for now. I hear the anger today, and I get it. I hope you take that anger straight to the polls next month. You may not be able to vote me out, but you can vote everyone else out. — Hello again! It’s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead. We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too). We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/). On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/) [mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/). Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way. Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway. —spez

Q: > 2) They've been gone a while, but we are chasing down an issue with incognito users seeing it more often. Please let me know if that's the case, or if you are having a different experience.

Mobile app prompts have been gone for a while? I see an [aggressive prompt](https://imgur.com/izp56QO) EVERY TIME I use Reddit on iOS Safari, not incognito.

There are some mild prompts, but the big issue is the full-screen popup that appears every time I try to click on comments. I must click "Not Now" on this modal every time I refresh Reddit or visit an external link.  It does not remember my preference at all.

Here are screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/9CGGwK4

A: 1) What are you referring to? Only new users see it by default. Most everyone else needs to opt in.

2) They've been gone a while, but we are chasing down an issue with incognito users seeing it more often. Please let me know if that's the case, or if you are having a different experience.*

3) Historically it has been optional, and it technically still is, though we're reconsidering it. While I was the original proponent of no-emails, we've found it to be problematic for a couple of reasons over the years: lost account passwords take time for our team to resolve, no emails makes tracking abuse more difficult, and there's more pressure than ever to fight such abuse, and it's generally helpful to be able to reach users where they are with important notifications.

4) Have heard this one before, and we're considering a couple other approaches. I didn't notice myself because my icons are always orange.

*Update: there was a lingering experiment that is now turned off.

A: 1) Can you please stop pushing the redesign so hard?

2) Can you stop the "Download the app" popups showing up so frequently on mobile?

3) Can you stop employing dark patterns such as [this](https://www.ploggingdev.com/images/dark_login.png) ? Email is optional and should be made clear.

4) Can you remove the [orange coloured chat icon](https://i.imgur.com/IXzbY36.png) next to my inbox?

Complaining aside, I continue to enjoy reddit, thanks!

You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA. Update: I've got to take off for now. I hear the anger today, and I get it.

Q: A couple of CEO posts ago, a big deal was made about the reddit canary being taken out indicating that Reddit as a company now had to conform to federal inquisitions for user data. Usually this means that a tool is made for federal investigators to gather data needed for whatever case they are working.  

So how are you as a company taking active measures to protect users data from similar breaches like what happened to Facebook, Equifax, and more recently; Apple, Uber, and Amazon. 
A: Breaches do happen, even to the best, as you point out. We've had a couple over the years, one of which we [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) a few months ago.

In addition to the standard best practices, we have a philosophical approach to storing as little personal information as possible. With limited exception, we don't know your names, addresses, genders, dob's, phone numbers, ssn's, or other sensitive information. We can't lose what we don't have.

I've always liked the saying "the best logs are no logs," which I believe came from the EFF.

Q: So, the recent quarantine wave:

/r/CringeAnarchy

/r/theredpill

/r/watchpeopledie

/r/ice_poseidon

/r/braincels

/r/FULLCOMMUNISM

/r/911truth

/r/mayo_town

/r/FragileJewishRedditor

/r/SubOfPeace

/r/WhiteBeauty

/r/White_Pride

/r/GentilesUnited

/r/ZOG

/r/GoyimDefenceForce

/r/AganistGayMarriage

/r/WhiteNationalism

/r/NorthwestFront

As many redditors have noticed, one of these things is not like the others. r/watchpeopledie is well-moderated not devoted to hate speech or hoaxes. Actually they are quite zealous in their moderation and removal of hate speech. On the other hand, it did present advertiser-unfriendly content that reddit likely didn't want new users stumbling upon. So what exactly is the purpose of quarantine? Either: 

1. Quarantine is for subs like r/watchpeopledie, ugly but well moderated communities that are allowed to stay on Reddit but need to be hidden away because of capitalism

2. Quarantine is a punishment for hate subs used to encourage them to reform or leave the platform.  

If quarantine is being used primarily in a #2 way, why not just ban these subs? Hate subs are not going to reform their moderation policies, or stop brigading other subreddits no matter what quarantine you place them under. In fact all you've done is give them a safe space, subsidized by the non-quarantined subreddits, where they can continue to discuss their ideology and organize brigades of public subs. 
A: (some of this I wrote elsewhere in the thread, but it's also relevant here)

In addition to updating the policy, we updated the tool as well. We may use it for both of the cases you mention.

The first version of quarantine was basically a death sentence for a community because it required community members to have verified email addresses. We decided that if we want to ban a community, we should just do so outright.

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

All quarantined communities continue to be subject to our site-wide content policies.

Q: Afternoon from the UK Spez, /r/funny here! Was a pleasure speaking to you during the London Roadshow.

What are we working on to combat the karma farming epidemic? politics and russian trolls aside, there's been an abhorrent amount of sheer shitposting cluttering up the default subs.

I understand we could code plugins or algorithms to sustain an improved automoderating system, but that sets a rather high expectation of knowledge in programming, as well as a volunteer willingness to work on something so extensive.

All of us default mods are hugely grateful for the improvements your teams have made to ease our burden a bit, but some of us feel there's still a ways to go before we get to stop spending all of our free time scooping buckets of water out of the ocean.

Edit; great response. And to everyone who seems to have a hard time understanding how /new works and instead chooses to abuse the mods, try keeping up with a twitch chat during a live esports tournament with no bottleneck to slow the message rate.

Now imagine that 24/7.

Now imagine filtering, tagging, banning, tracking groups, and responding to messages at that pace. 

Your abusive attitude towards those who volunteer their time to battle such a seemingly hopeless cause with no reward but their own understanding that they get to help the community should embarrass you.
A: Thanks for the question, and thanks for hanging with us. Help is coming.

We know these kinds of accounts have been a problem, and they’re not easy for moderators to deal with alone. We’ve talked a bit elsewhere about a relatively new team we’ve spun up to deal with content manipulation. While their focus has been largely on political manipulation, many of the same tools and methods they’re developing are also effective against these kinds of spam networks. As those things work their way into production, we hope you’ll see far less of these accounts in your subreddits.

One of the specific focuses of the Anti-Evil team going forward is to "reduce janitorial work" for our team and moderators alike.

Similarly, improved tools that don't require as much technical knowledge are on the roadmap.

Q: Last time there was an admin post, we from /r/argentina complained about the advertising blitz we've received from Monsanto. Their ads are misleading, they claim to be from reputable websites then redirect to another. Our mod team has repeatedly reported it, so have our users, we're sick of seeing it over and over and OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It's like the only ad you see if you have an Argentinian IP. It's nuts. Please please do something about it or at least acknowledge the problem. 

I know Monsanto is a contentious subject but forget politics, we're just sick of being bombarded by the goddamn ads. 
A: The advertiser was banned a while ago, and we've been watching for any additional accounts. Please do continue to report the ads if you see anything. Sorry for the trouble.

Q: > As long as the mods of that community continue to cooperate with us in enforcing our site-wide rules, they're not going to see a ban.

That didn't stop you from quarantining (soft ban with the current implementation) r/watchpeopledie

If quarantine wasn't intended to be a soft ban it would function more like NSFW and be globally bypassable via user opt in.

If it was treated as a label for users to control their own experience I'd be all for it.

Q: Hi, /u/spez!

I have a very simple question that many, many of us would love an answer to. 

Why the fuck is /r/The_Donald still around, and why did the Reddit admins go out of their way to nuke the post that that guy made pointing out the Russian interference within that sub?
A: **as it relates to the_donald**

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

This does not mean we are not going to enforce our content policy on the_donald, nor does it mean we don't expect full cooperation from the mods in doing so.

**regarding the Russian interference post from a couple weeks ago**

We didn't remove anything. The [user removed the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/9hqzb5/rfuckthealtright_mod_made_a_detailed_post_of_his/e6e4dzf/), and resubmissions of that post were removed as spam because some of the domains in the post were subsequently banned by us.

Q: During the last election cycle, we saw fraudulent scams by Russian Hackers. How does Reddit plan to protect itself from these hackers to keep itself from being the next Facebook or twitter?
A: We're strengthening the measures we have in place to limit the impact of any malicious actors. 

Here are a few of them:

* dedicated teams that enforce our policies, proactively go after bad actors, and create eng solutions to prevent them in the future,
* a new team specifically devoted to investigating efforts to manipulate our site,
* we’re working on improving communication to/from this team with a trusted reporter system and increasing our presence in subreddits where users are already investigating suspicious activity \[link: [investigations@reddit.zendesk.com](mailto:investigations@reddit.zendesk.com)\], 
* working with industry peers (and parts of the government working to ensure election security) to help us detect and stop emerging malicious activity
* As we’ve always done, we’ll also have an in-house "war room" monitoring for suspicious activity around election day.

In the meantime, transparency is also critical, to help educate users and the public about techniques bad actors are trying out. We've been forthcoming about suspected influence campaigns with you (recent examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/)) and will continue to do so as needed.

A: You send can suspicious accounts to investigations@reddit.zendesk.com, and it will get to the right people.

Q: What do you actually do as the CEO of Reddit?
A: I spend the majority of my time doing four things:

* Working with our product teams to improve Reddit, which these days is focused on how do we make Reddit more accessible to new users
* Recruiting
* Communicating internally to the company about what we're doing and why we're doing it
* Taking my lumps with the community, which is what I'm doing right now

Q: Detailed posts have shown r/the_donald being responsible for pushing russian propaganda through use of coordinated bots and bogus fake articles.

r/the_donald also frequently participates in hate speech, including but not limited to: anti-muslim rhetoric, violence surrounding neo-nazi rally in 2017, death threats against John McCain and others, etc.

When will you address this issue? When will you stand up to attacks on our democracy by Russia, specifically propagated through a community on your site?

edit: here’s the post outlining r/the_donald’s rampant violation of reddit rules. sorry trolls :p

http://archive.is/qIDX7

also notice it’s an archive, because certain reddit mods were scared of the truth and deleted the original
A: My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) documented exactly what we know and what we're doing about foreign influence on Reddit. We also listed the accounts that were involved so that you can see for yourself what they were up to.

In August, we wrote a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/) regarding an Iranian attempt at manipulation.

A couple weeks ago, we saw another round of posts centered around usareally.com, which is now banned. What we found in this case was that the users behind it were indeed of Russian origin, though we have no technical evidence that they are affiliated with the IRA. Similar to the IRA's previous efforts, this group's efforts were largely not effective: They submitted 953 posts to 130 different communities. Of the 264 posts submitted to r/the_donald, only one made it into the top 100, and 0 made it into the top 25.

We have a team dedicated to finding and preventing coordinated behavior to manipulate Reddit. The first question whenever we find anything is, "what could we have done to find this sooner?" In this case, we would have liked to have caught and banned the domains sooner because they were behaving in a spammy matter, and have adjusted our processes to do so going forward.

If you do find anything of this nature, please send it to directly to investigations@reddit.zendesk.com.

Q: When are you going to ban huge subreddits that constantly have [upvoted calls to violence](https://removeddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9ksmno/simply_put_the_democrats_are_a_party_of_terrorists/e71ziol/?st=jmtuiqw2&sh=1d3b8138) that their mods ignore and that violate all your sitewide rules? Why have you been dragging your feet on this?Why have you continued to **actively aid** the spread of [disingenuous paid propaganda](https://old.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/9hu52u/the_donald_is_actively_promoting_russian/) ?

Why do you continue to push "new reddit" when it absolutely sucks in terms of wasted space and shit performance?
A: You're linking to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9ksmno/simply_put_the_democrats_are_a_party_of_terrorists/e71ziol/) that was removed by mods before it got any traction on a post that was also removed mods.

As long as the mods of that community continue to cooperate with us in enforcing our site-wide rules, they're not going to see a ban.

Q: Why in the world do you ask me every other page view to download the app? I like mweb, I hate apps. Please stop. 
A: We dialed that way back a couple weeks ago. It should be just a little button now.

One thing that might be happening for folks is seeing more prompts because they use incognito because we're losing the cookie that stores whether they've seen the prompt. We're dialing it back for incognito as well in the near future.

Q: Do you take to heart the thousands of posts outlining why people hate new Reddit?
A: We do, in fact. We wrote a [lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/9iu1ax/we_conducted_an_opt_out_survey_on_new_reddit_here/) about how we collect and respond to feedback just last week.

tl;dr: about 70% of user are on the redesign, and the top two complaints are "change aversion" and "performance".

Long story short, we hear it, we see it, and we've been working hard to make the redesign great. The top priority for us right is performance, and we've made quite a bit of improvement over the last month.

It’s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead. We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too). We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/). On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/) [mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/). Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way. Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway. —spez

Q: Will you ever remove /r/the_donald?
A: EDIT:

Your original comment was:

> What is one thing you which you had introduce to reddit sooner but didn't.

You've since edited it to be about r/the_donald. It's disingenuous to edit your comment after I've answered and not admit that you did so.

My original answer:

One thing we really haven't nailed yet is onboarding. We have incredible breadth and depth in our communities that isn't well represented in r/popular, which is what new users see when they first arrive to Reddit. I think we can do a much better job highlighting what Reddit's all about.

In subreddit: modnews

Making it easier to host events Hi Mods, We’ve been working on a few things to make it easier for you to host events for your communities. Over the last week, we’ve invited a few mod teams (see comments for the list) to start trying them out as a beta, so we wanted to let the rest of you know what’s up as well. # Why are we doing this? Many people come to Reddit during events—whether it's an AMA, a TV show premiere, a sports finale, or [another newsworthy development](https://redditblog.com/2018/07/12/thanosdidnothingwrong/). The problem is that it’s hard for users to find these events (both when they’re happening and when the next one is occurring) and even harder for mods to host and manage them using our existing tools. Solutions like AutoModerator scheduler aren’t super accessible or easy to use for mods who aren't already AutoMod wizards, and other hacks communities have used to manage events have shown us where our tools could be improved. # So, what are the features? We're building a suite of mod-only features to solve these problems: * **Event post metadata**: This gives mods the ability to [add start/end date/time information to posts](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izc0y/add_event_data/). Users can see the start/end time from listings pages and on the posts themselves and “follow” the events. In the coming weeks, following the event will send them an app notification when the event starts. * **Post submission scheduling:** This gives mods the ability to schedule when a post should be submitted. The first version of post scheduling will be event-focused with options to submit now or submit at event start time only. * **Post collections:** This gives mods the ability to [group posts together in a community “collection”](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izc6i/collection_mod_flow/). Users will be able to view and switch between [posts within a collection easily](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izbxn/collection_demo/). They can share a collection URL, which will automatically direct them to the in-progress/most recent event post (e.g., if I made a collection of pre-, live- and post- game threads for last week’s Notre Dame v Wake Forest college football game and you clicked the collection URL, it would open the post- game thread. If I clicked that same link when the game was in progress, I’d see the live- game thread). That said, you can still easily get back to the other posts in the collection as well. We’ve broken event metadata, post scheduling, and post collections into separate features because we believe they have broader utility than the Events-specific use case and want to give mods flexibility as you test these out. Our goal for each of these is to reduce the amount of time/effort you put into hosting an event on Reddit and to make it easier for more mods to help host. As we evaluate these features, we may decide to invest more in some and less in others. Your feedback will help us prioritize this and we’ll keep you posted along the way. # I want to try it out, how can I? We’re testing these features out with a few mod teams and going to launch a series of improvements over the next month or so. For now, you can [join our waitlist](https://goo.gl/forms/dgs8p2jD73ZahhIi1). We’ll enable more mod teams periodically. Thanks, u/0perspective &#x200B; UPDATED 3/14: We've made a few Event and Collections endpoints available for our beta communities to start trying out and giving us feedback on. You can read more about these APIs here, https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/.

Q: Back when /r/science hosted AMAs, collections would have been perfect for organizing our themed AMA weeks.
A: For different use cases, we're really excited to see the creative use cases the communities come up with. Some idea we've talked about internally a few

\-- All the discussion threads for seasons 2 of Game of Thrones

\-- Best 401k advice

\-- This weeks best OC

\-- Chronicling the developing news like (Hurricane Florence)

\-- Eventually we could see mod teams use this for megathreads.

**What ideas do you have?**  


As for API access, it's something we're considering this during the beta. **How would you use API access?**

A: Yes we like this. Can you talk about different use cases you have envisioned for the post collections tool? Will the collections have an exposed public API? 

In subreddit: Drama

Time to monologue at you. #[you can enable username mentions here.](http://justcool393.pythonanywhere.com/r/Drama/enable_username_mentions) --- hey guys, gals, and non-gender-binary-conforming people, just wanted to tell you an update on the site rules and how they relate to Drama. 1. because we can't have nice pings, we, as of now, can't allow username mentions on the subreddit except for people who are okay with it. ~~eventually, I'll write a bot or something to automatically approve people who want pings, but for now see the stickied comment.~~ 2. last time we told you stop the "kill yourself" and other harassing comments and PMs against other people because those are against site rules. we are reiterating this. 3. stop brigading as well. [this is the definition of brigading](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/4u9bbg/please_define_vote_brigading/d5nxoc5/). don't do it. 4. [in general, follow the rules of reddit](/rules). there isn't much more to say than this. if you have any questions, username ping me in the thread.

Q: Can we still ping /u/spez? And oops. 
A: I can handle it. 

In subreddit: inthesoulstone

An update on going private We would like to formally apologise to everyone r/inthesoulstone for the lack of communication & delay regarding going private. We know you are pissed and you have every right to be. You all have been demanding to go private for so long now. And no, we haven’t forgotten about it. We admit, there have been quite a few hiccups along the way but the good news is we've managed to solve most of the problems, except for one. The Reddit API limits the amount of approved users to 200 per hour. In theory, that would take around 40 days to manually approve 230,000 souls. In addition, the mod team would also have to clear and archive 230k+ modmails, each of it being a notification that the user is now an approved submitter in the subreddit. We would rather take a quicker path. Quite a few people here have wrongly assumed that manually approving 230k+ souls shouldn’t be a problem. If that’s the case, let me make it absolutely clear that we have a mod team consisting of 8 people, with each of them having their own personal lives to attend to. It’s just not practically possible, yet we are still considering it as an option but of the last resort. We have been trying to get in touch with the Reddit admins regarding our API issue but haven’t yet received any response in return. We are also aware of the fact that the bot has stopped responding to the “!snapme” command and we're working on fixing it. At last, If anyone here has any other ideas they would like to bounce off or any solutions they would like to share, please do let us know in the comments below. \###Update u/spez: "I believe the infra team is swamped with Official Business right now. I’ll bring it up when they come up for air."

Q: This is true. Here are the two earliest known self-posts:

6 Jan 2006:  https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/24912/ask_reddit_were_can_a_student_get_internshipstyle/

16 Jan 2006: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/27353/recursive_reddit_self_link/
A: This was actually the origin of self posts, they were not originally a reddit feature, but users created the feature by guessing the link to their own post.

In subreddit: TheoryOfReddit

Has r/popular caused the loss of actually discussion on Reddit for new users (and by extension, all of Reddit over time)? Edit - sorry about the typo, phone keyboard. Please don't spam r/titlegore in the comments Back when the site had a list of curated defaults, new users were exposed to a variety of quality topics and communities that delivered a great deal of quality discussion Now with r/popular the user experience is almost entirely driven by comedy and memes since this content gets a quick reaction from the most users and thus the highest ranking on the site. Content with more substance doesn't reach users who aren't already subscribed to these subreddits. I don't have a good example off the top of my head but when a non comedy oriented sub his the front page, it's almost always just because somebody posted a meta meme that gets the most laughs. Is Reddit going to continue to let this happen? You can say that users have the option to go find subs to subscribe to, but I really think this is a loss of the quality discussion Reddit was once known for.

Q: You might be right. We noticed this too and have been looking into it. We will have more to share soon.
A: Dang I was just writing a reply to this as well. Guess we got the same push notif.

In subreddit: redesign

Links in a post no longer look anything like links, and probably should There is no style around the link that this user posted. Meaning, old school websites would have the text blue and underlined. For what it is worth, that style is preserved when I go to the page with all of my comments, but not within the subreddit itself. Is this a subreddit specific style, or a global setting? \(Either way, I hope it can be rethought. I read the dude's comment with a fine toothed comb, making sure my tired eyes were not missing a link. The only thing I did \*not\* do was literally mouse over those two words...\) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep\_Track/comments/8nrmlk/there\_was\_a\_second\_seychelles\_meeting/dzy514v/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/8nrmlk/there_was_a_second_seychelles_meeting/dzy514v/)

Q: What do you think?
A: I was just about the tell the team about this one as well. Underlining markdown links would be nice. For some themes, the color choices make links in comments and posts basically invisible.

In subreddit: redesign

After 3 months of negative comments about inline ads, are there any statements about how they are going to change? From what I can see, disguising them as posts is only generating animosity towards the advertisers.

Q: What do you think?
A: The ads will change. While they will stay inline, we are going to try a few more versions. The trade off of course is that if they stand out too much, they’re distracting, if they are too subtle, they’re deceptive. We’re trying to find the right balance.

I'll spare you our excuses for while we haven't been more responsive on this particular topic, but suffice to say we can do better on the communication, and I'll work on that as well.

In subreddit: cscareerquestions

Expectations from a new grad and how to improve? I recently interviewed with a startup (small, 10-20 engineers) and was given a timed take home assignment. I have just graduated college with a B.S. in CS from a top 15 school with an average GPA and two past internships. My Github page has a bunch of projects. (none of them would be considered production quality though) After the take home I was told that although they were impressed with my ability my code style and quality weren't up to the par with production quality code. The problem I encountered was that the take home had a very specific problem and creating an extensible solution proved to be difficult. How can I improve myself in that aspect? How does one improve the "production quality" level of their code without being on the job and learning from others? This may sound like a rant but I genuinely want to improve and hopefully work with this company in the future.

Q: hi Boss. meta question: do reddit engineers go on reddit during work hours?
A: I’ve given that sort of feedback to newbies many times. If you put the code online somewhere or PM it to me, I’d be happy to take a look.

/r/science is no longer doing AMA's due to drop off in visibility caused by the change to "best" sorting from hot. https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8khscc/rscience_will_no_longer_be_hosting_amas

Q: What do you think?
A: I left a longer [explanation](https://new.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8khscc/rscience_will_no_longer_be_hosting_amas/dz8nky8/) in that thread, but the gist of it is r/science isn't a default anymore and their tactic of removing more popular posts to promote AMAs is not allowed.

The "best" sort should actually help communities like r/science get more visibility. That's the whole point. Though it's not really relevant right now since their AMA shenanigans predate any algorithm changes.
