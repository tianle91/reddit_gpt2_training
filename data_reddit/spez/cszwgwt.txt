Title: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Body: Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

Q: What do you think?
A: going to copy and paste my questions from the AMA Request thread: * Will we be allowing a return of subreddits such as /r/fatpeoplehate, or will it remained banned? * If subreddits such as FPH will remain banned, will any with extremely racist content (im looking at you /r/CoonTown) subreddits that enable vote manipulation (/r/srs or /r/BestOf) or any with extremely disturbing content (/r/watchpeopledie /r/picsofdeadkids /r/sexyabortions) be allowed to stay up? * If so, why? * What were Ellen's previous projects and in what ways will you be continuing them? * Will you listen to the community on any of their greater complaints or will most decisions be Director's Board-made with no say in the other way?

A: Not ignoring you, but I think I've answered all of these in this thread.
