Title: Expectations from a new grad and how to improve?

Body: I recently interviewed with a startup (small, 10-20 engineers) and was given a timed take home assignment. I have just graduated college with a B.S. in CS from a top 15 school with an average GPA and two past internships. My Github page has a bunch of projects. (none of them would be considered production quality though) After the take home I was told that although they were impressed with my ability my code style and quality weren't up to the par with production quality code. The problem I encountered was that the take home had a very specific problem and creating an extensible solution proved to be difficult. How can I improve myself in that aspect? How does one improve the "production quality" level of their code without being on the job and learning from others? This may sound like a rant but I genuinely want to improve and hopefully work with this company in the future.

Q: What do you think?
A: I’ve given that sort of feedback to newbies many times. If you put the code online somewhere or PM it to me, I’d be happy to take a look.
