Title: [Request] AMA between /u/spez and the mods

Body: Some of his comments in the public AMA regarding shadowbans and deletion are going to be of great concern to more than just a few mods.  I'm predicting another sitewide shitstorm if the concerns about it are not addressed sooner rather than later.

Q: What do you think?
A: I wrote these two comments in /r/modtalk and /r/IAmA. Here is the brunt of my concern: ______ From the AMA: >Ever. If we, or moderators, ban them, or specific content, it will be obvious that it's happened and there will be a mechanism for appealing the decision. "Would you agree that real users have a right to know when their post or comment has been removed?" >Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. <rant>Also, I hate seeing [deleted] all over the place. I don't care if it was deleted, I want to read it anyway.</rant> "What about subs like r/askhistorians where they have high standards?" >I think mods should be able to moderate, but there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed. It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible. "What do you plan on doing about censorship on reddit? An example would be /r/News censoring topics on TPP" >They can ban what they want, but I'd like to make it transparent what was actually banned. Some sort of "garbage can" or something. Spez. I strongly advice you not to implement these ideas into reddit. This might kill a lot of really good subreddits and force others off default or /r/all. This is a question of resources. We moderators already can have very full plates. I for one know for a fact that if your ideas general even a trivial amount of more work for /r/AskScience, we will simply be unable to keep up. I believe /r/Science feels the same and many of the series subs like /r/history or /r/askhistorians would have objections as well. ______ Spez, I don't think you understand what an impossible idea this is. Some of the biggest and high quality subs moderate and remove thousands of comments for a variety of reasons. Are you telling us that we, moderators, need to be accountable for every single removal? This simply isn't a feasible prospect and the best mod tools in the world will not make it so. Why should /r/AskScience allow users to appeal our decision to ban young earth creationism in that sub? Or holocaust denial in /r/history? Why make more work for the good folks at /r/AskHistorians?

A: I think I've said many times that my intention isn't to make anyone's duties more difficult. I believe we can build better tools that will save everyone time. I also believe that shadow banning shouldn't be the only option because it isn't needed in many cases. It happens that in practice is *is* the only option, but we can build a better variety of tools. After seeing all the discussion over the weekend, I think the most important thing we can do is work on tools to curb harassment of mods. I won't have time for an AMA tomorrow, but I'll find some time later this week.
