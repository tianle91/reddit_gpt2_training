Title: AMA about my darkest secrets

Body: Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later.

Q: What do you think?
A: When will m.reddit.com be not horrible and useless, and what was the impetus to change it from not horrible and useless to horrible and useless originally?

A: Hi Spez. I made this account on the dawn of the last retarded thing you said. I'm sure you've said lots of dumb shit between now and then but hey, that's not the issue. Literally forcing my phone into m.reddit.com mode is goddam cancer. Is there any way to opt out of it or am I fucked for good?
