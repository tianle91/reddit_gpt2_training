Title: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Body: Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

Q: What do you think?
A: More of a quality of life question... If you have to choose between an area where you are happier outside of work or a more interesting career, how do you weigh those options?

A: Cliche answer: try to find the one that satisfies both. Some people really just want to work hard and live at work. That was me for a while. These days, I put a lot more thought into my life outside of work. I know I can't be effective at work if I'm stressed, not getting exercise, missing my friends, not sleeping, etc.
