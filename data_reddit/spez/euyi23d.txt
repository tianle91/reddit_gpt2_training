Title: There should be an option to change your username but...

Body: But there will be a limit so no will change for the username constantly, I think you should only be able to change your username 2 times. Or maybe even 1. I mean look at my username! Yes, I want to be a screenwriter but I don't want to run it around. (Which is my fault)

Q: What do you think?
A: I'd be supportive of once a year or so. We can technically do it now, but I think there are bunch of little edge cases we'd need to explore before making it real. It could be an interesting Premium/Gold feature to allow it more often.
