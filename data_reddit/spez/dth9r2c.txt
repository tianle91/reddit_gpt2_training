Title: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

Body: Hello again,

Now that it’s far enough into the year that we’re all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I’d give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we’re working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven’t tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we’re still working on these features and we’ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you’d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I’m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I’m serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.

Q: What do you think?
A: I don't want to download your app. At various times, the mobile website seems to introduce more annoying delay features to force me go get the app. First you had the reddit icon slowly fill with color with instructions to download the app, whereas before a post would instantly load. Now, it looks like you delay the comments from appearing, again replaced with a delay causing message telling me to download the app. I don't want your app. Can you please stop these unnecessary delays?

A: There aren't any fake delays.
