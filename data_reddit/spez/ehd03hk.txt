Title: Rule management on new Reddit

Body: Hey everyone,

We‚Äôre excited to bring you rule management on new Reddit today! This encompasses the creation, editing, and deletion of rules, where changes will be reflected on both new and old sites.  

The Rules page can be accessed through your subreddit‚Äôs mod hub, under the ‚ÄúRules and Regulations‚Äù section. One new feature on the Rules page will be **rule reordering** via drag-and-drop, so you no longer have to delete everything and re-add rules. If you reorder a rule on the new site, the change will be reflected on the old site, without you having to delete and re-add them. We hope this makes your life a little bit easier when making edits to rules in your community! 

Some things to note: 

* We‚Äôve increased the maximum number of rules per community from 10 to 15.
* We‚Äôve increased the character limit of rule short names from 50 to 100.
* We‚Äôve increased the character limit of rule report reasons from 50 to 100. 
* Rule numbering has been added to the old site to reflect the new site. We did this to reduce the confusion of double-numbering, and the work of having to add numbers to rules. This will also maintain consistency for rules throughout Reddit‚Äôs communities, making it easier for users to understand.

A: Got it. Reordering for removal reasons seems pretty reasonable to me!
