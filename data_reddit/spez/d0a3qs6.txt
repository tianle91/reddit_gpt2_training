Body: 

Q: What do you think?
A: Fun fact: this was one of [the first posts ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/2439/flash_how_to_fold_a_shirt/). I think this is the original, but maybe I found one of the first reposts ever. I recall this being the first and only Reddit link I showed my grandma. I've been folding shirts this way for over 10 years as a result.
