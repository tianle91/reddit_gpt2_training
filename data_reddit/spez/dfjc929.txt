Title: The email I wrote u/spez from Singapore on July 11, 2004 that kicked off our entrepreneurial career together

Body: I don't think I've ever used so many "bros" in my entire life, but here's the original email I sent Steve in all of its embarrassing glory. We started working on our original company, My Mobile Menu (MMM!) not long after I got back to the States that summer of our third year at UVA. That's "the pitch" I'm referring to below. Reddit came later. That's another post...

> hey bro,

> i’m in singapore at this technepreneurial seminar, and am basically spending a week learning how to create a tech start-up.i spoke to Mark White (a professor in the comm school, the guy who took me to South Africa, and who recruited me to come here, as well as a generally good guy and technophile) over some drinks last nite, and pitched him on our idea…from his feedback–and let me remind you that he gets pitches every couple of months from students, and was very candid and honest with his thoughts, but basically said it was one of the best he’s heard, period.

> Not only that, but he wants to be on the board of directors, and already knows some people to hit up for starting capital…

> I’ve got plenty of more details, but I am seriously considering putting off law school for this, but i need you, and we’ll both need to be doing this full time for about a year to get it off the ground….but the potential he saw was in the millions my friend…we need to talkseriously.i am coming back the 20th so if we could have lunch around 1pm i could meet you whereever you’d like… let me know.

> honestly, this is the kind of thing that could change our lives–and his motivation has really spurred me.but i need you and the same kind of commitment.

Q: What do you think?
A: Let's be clear: that pitch that was "one of the best he's heard," wasn't Reddit. Who knows what it could have been? Oh, well. There's always another train coming.
