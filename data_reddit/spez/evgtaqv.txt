Title: Can barefoot running cause you to develop arches?

Body: I'm in my 40's and as long as I remember, I've had flat wide feet.  Like a cartoon duck.  I'm hardly an athlete, but this summer I've been working at barefoot running on grass and I'm proud to say I can now run a continuous 22 mins and cover 3.5 KM.  

Today while walking on the driveway I noticed that I seem to have a small arch.  I inspected my feet and realized they look slightly different than I remember them, but this could be my imagination.

I'm wondering if this is something others have observed.  Does barefoot running "fix" or help with flat-footedness?

Edit - thanks for all the feedback everyone!

Q: What do you think?
A: To echo many people here, yes, that’s been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). I find that simply walking is not enough. It’s running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits.
