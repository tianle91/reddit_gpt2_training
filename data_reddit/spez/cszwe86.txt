In subreddit: IAmA

Title: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Body: Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

Q: What do you think?
A: I have a fear that you have been gone from reddit too long and could be out of touch with the average redditor today. How do we know you are going to make the right choices as your time as CEO?

A: I haven't been posting much, but I have been reading reddit pretty much every day for ten years, which is more than you can say.
