Title: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Body: Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

Annnnnnd in other news:

In case you didn’t catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, we’re running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!

This weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1251). Join our team, play games with the Reddit staff, and help us hit our $250k fundraising goal.

Finally, today we’re kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, I’m no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I’d love some ideas to keep me busy.

-Steve

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers!

Q: What do you think?
A: Hiya Spez. Does Reddit have any plans to stratify (1) and fix (2) the way moderators work? (1) The moderator hierarchy is currently top down, which means one stoned/drunk/cranky mod can effectively mess up all mods below them. I would recommend you think of making permissions more granular than the 6/7 categories that exist (full, access, config, mail, flair, post, wiki). There should be a provision available for mods below to nuke mods on top or change their permissions, if such permissions have been granted to them (and so on). It will make mod lists far more equitable in nature, and reduce the pressure on admins to step in an fix issues. (2) Additionally, why does Reddit administration disappear on weekends? Facebook and Twitter are said to be hiring mods, and you can [view a Facebook mods profile here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/facebook-moderators-quick-guide-job-challenges). Why doesn't Reddit think of doing this - hiring sitewide "supermods" who aren't exactly admins but not pleb mods either, to step in and stop blatant vote manipulation (like the sock guy) or dox and stuff. This is especially necessary on the weekends, when it is hard to get any response from admins. I've seen calls for hiring "supermods" on a few of these threads, and the admins are kind of mute about this. I'm not sure what you think of this so please let me know.

A: 1. Great question. Subreddit governance is a huge challenge. We've not tackled it directly to date because there has been so much foundational work to get out of the way first (e.g. moderator guidelines, real mod tools, fully developed community team). We're getting closer. 2. We are still a small company, fewer than 300 people. We're actively hiring for weekend coverage right now, so hopefully the next time we chat we have this problem solved.

A: > real mod tools Just to follow up, I think moderator permissions are tools in themselves. A lot of subreddits organize mod's duties and rules by the permissions they have, and you're kind of glossing over this crucial fact. Anyway thanks for replying, happy thanksgiving and ban /r/onionhate before /u/sodypop wakes up

A: You're right, adding more mod permissions is an easy improvement. We have a "moderators" dev team now. At the moment they're working on an enhanced mod queue, subreddit styling, and a new flair system.

A: Yep. Proper mod tools for mobile are in development now. They'll ship in the next major (4.0) release, which we expect this year.
