Title: An actual fix for the scrolling performance issue on the Lightbox scroller on macOS Safari

Body: I made a post a month ago saying I found a fix and it got over 200 upvotes, but the post ended up being confusing because I was mistaken in what I thought the problem was. I can see that it hasn't been fixed still.

However, I actually found a fix after taking another look.

When you open a post, the #overlayScrollContainer element receives focus, presumably for accessibility reasons. For whatever reason, this element having focus causes the lag (20 fps scrolling). If you click anywhere on the container once it's open, the performance issue vanishes until you close it and reopen another post. Something to do with focus is causing the issue. 

[I notice that there's another inner div also with `tabindex="-1"` within the scrollable container.](https://i.gyazo.com/2e671e874ab51e2716a7cb752b8ba74f.png).

**If you give the focus to this inner element instead of the parent scroller, there is no performance issue.** (Scrolling becomes 60 fps). I assume there is no problem with accessibility here because the Lightbox scroller is still in focus, it's just the direct child of the element with the overflow-y rule.

Here's some code you can paste in the console while navigating between posts.

    setInterval(() => {
      const scroller = document.querySelector('#overlayScrollContainer')
      if (scroller) {
        console.log('Applying scrolling fix')
        scroller.firstElementChild.focus()
      }
    }, 10000) // <-- 10 seconds; change to any number in ms

Hopefully this actually solves the issue now and Safari scrolling can finally be fixed!

Q: What do you think?
A: Well this is a nice surprise. Works for me. u/keysersosa can you please take a look?
