Title: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Body: Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

Annnnnnd in other news:

In case you didn’t catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, we’re running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!

This weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1251).

Finally, today we’re kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, I’m no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I’d love some ideas to keep me busy.

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers!

Q: What do you think?
A: Why aren't alpha testers getting responses from admins? I asked what the goal of the redesign is and the question went completely unanswered. So......what is the goal of the redesign? What makes it a success? Without a goal, we're all just yelling out suggestions pretending to have opinions that matter. >I'm new here, so I'm sorry if this has been explained and I missed it, but what is the goal of the redesign? >As a web developer with 13 years of experience, it makes me nervous to see a redesign project without a clearly defined goal. Did a [pointy-haired boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss) just walk in one day and announce a redesign? What goal determines that the redesign is successful? Without that we're all just a bunch of chiefs shouting out suggestions.

A: I'm not sure the forum in which you're not getting responses. If you clarify, I will follow up with the team. However I can assure you we are receiving great feedback and even if you don't get a direct response from us, we are making a ton of improvements based on what we're hearing from testers. There are a variety of goals, but chief among them is decreasing the bounce rate of first-time visitors and increasing time on site for everyone. More generally, Reddit grows primarily through word of mouth. Many of us evangelize Reddit and tell people how awesome it is, what an impact it's made in their life, how much it makes them laugh, etc, and then when those new people decide to check out Reddit for the first time they're greeted with dystopian Craigslist. We'd like to fix that.
