Title: Upcoming AMA Announcement - Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman (aka u/Spez) April 24th

Body: We hit 100K readers this week and I'd hoped we could do something big to commemorate the occasion. After a little [back and forth](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/853038610869866497) with u/kn0thing (co-founder Alexis Ohanian) on Twitter and some arrangements with Reddit's PR team, we can now announce that Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman (u/Spez) will be doing an AMA with us on Monday April 24th at 4PM EDT / 1PM PDT. And he's already [verified](http://imgur.com/JNyzBwJ) with a bit of current events humor.

Internships for everybody?? Please keep it classy.


This from Spez
Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid and in high school and college at Virginia (CS major), I worked as a developer. As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! Oh, and, we’re hiring...

Q: What do you think?
A: You do say reddit is hiring, but we hear that all the time. Companies that say this usually mean that they're passively hiring the same way an engineer will say "I'm keeping my eyes out for opportunities" even though some may not go anywhere at all. Is Reddit passively hiring or actively hiring? By active, I mean going through an expansion and have to fill-in those positions by a certain deadline.
