In subreddit: announcements

Title: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

Body: I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!

Q: What do you think?
A: Reddit is [still losing prominent employees](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/28/reddit-employee-leaves/30778971/) working directly in areas which your post suggests Reddit is working on. What's up with that? And why no hiring announcements?

A: Jessica leaving is entirely to do with her family moving back to Salt Lake City. She's not leaving right this minute, and she's helping us work through the Content Policy. We are hiring at the same time, of course, but I'm just getting warmed up.

A: Why aren't you letting employees work remotely, away from the SF office? (Marking this comment for the inevitable link to /r/subredditdrama)

A: This policy will likely change in the long-term. In the short-term we need to come together internally. It's been a chaotic year for everyone here, and we have a lot of rebuilding to do. The vibe around the office is already better now than it was a few weeks ago (I hope they agree!), and in a few months we'll be a lot stronger.
