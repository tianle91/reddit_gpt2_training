In subreddit: IAmA

Title: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Body: Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

Q: What do you think?
A: So, do you plan on to walk in the path set by Pao, or will you try to revert her plans and go to the old - "we support the freedom of speech" which was the reddit's stance few years ago and is one of the reasons why people signed the petition? I mean FPH was one sad shit of a place, but shadowbanning and mass deleting of comments by admins is not nice.

A: We want to support as free and open a discussion is possible. reddit is a platform for having some of the most authentic conversations online, if not in the world, and I don't want to undermine that. Shadowbanning sucks. Moderators lack tools right now to effectively moderate. Sometimes people do need to be banned, but it shouldn't be a secret, and there should be an appeals process to undo it.
