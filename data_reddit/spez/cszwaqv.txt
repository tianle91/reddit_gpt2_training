In subreddit: IAmA

Title: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Body: Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

Q: What do you think?
A: What do you plan on doing about censorship on reddit? An example would be [/r/News censoring topics on TPP](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3avmmi/posts_about_tpp_are_being_removed_all_over_reddit/)

A: They can ban what they want, but I'd like to make it transparent what was actually banned. Some sort of "garbage can" or something.
