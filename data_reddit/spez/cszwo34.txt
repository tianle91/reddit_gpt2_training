In subreddit: IAmA

Title: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Body: Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

Q: What do you think?
A: Hey Steve! Weekly, or at least semi-regular, AMAs are an awesome idea. Maybe different admin teams at reddit could step up and do some too! Any thoughts on how reddit should prioritize the needs of brand new users (who may find various aspects of reddit's design complicated and confusing) with the needs of core users and mods (who reddit relies on for its great content and dankest of memes)?

A: Really good question, thank you. I think the new user / core user dichotomy is the biggest product challenge we fact right now. Solve it, and we are unstoppable. A vague answer, I know, but this is one of the big things on my mind.
