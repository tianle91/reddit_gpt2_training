In subreddit: IAmA

Title: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Body: Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

Q: What do you think?
A: What is your view on reddit's employees negotiating their salary? What are your views on "offensive" subreddits? What are your views on Donald Trump?

A: > What is your view on reddit's employees negotiating their salary? Hipmunk has this policy as well, and it works well for us. It only works if you pay the market rate, which we will. We're not in the business of getting good people for as cheap as possible.
