<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators! <u/[deleted]>: [deleted] <u/spez>: The strongest newbie's I've hired have a couple things in common:

* They have a great attitude. They work on every problem thrown at them, and when they have nothing to do, they find more work. One guy I work with (who worked with me at Hipmunk and is now at Reddit), used to sit next to me and just fix my bugs. I could move a lot faster, and he learned a ton.

* They study outside of work. I think this advice holds true forever, but it's certainly true in the beginning: even a single weekend of studying a specific technology will make you dramatically better. The aforementioned engineer was trying to get better at frontend. Instead of waiting for the work to come to him, he learned an incredible amount of CSS in one weekend and came to work on Monday ready to take on a never level of work he couldn't do on Friday.
