<u/the-crotch>: What you're describing is a self post, there's a button for it

<u/FreeSpeechWarrior>: This was actually the origin of self posts, they were not originally a reddit feature, but users created the feature by guessing the link to their own post.



<u/RunDNA>: This is true. Here are the two earliest known self-posts:

<u/spez>: There are also a bunch of examples of users guessing wrong, which created all sorts of hilarious confusion.

The first version of text posts required the user to type “self” in the url field to create it automatically. 

These days, text posts make up about half Reddit’s submissions. Beyond subreddits and comments, it was probably the most significant feature we built.
