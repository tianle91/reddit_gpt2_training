Title: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Body: Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

Q: What do you think?
A: Hi Spez! I'm a Senior Mobility Engineer, and I've recently fallen into a rut regarding job interest. I'm in golden handcuffs having excellent benefits/salary, but experience an increasing degree of boredom due to the slow pace of work at my company. I was wondering if you've ever experienced a rut at any point in your career, and if so, what were the steps you followed to correct it? Thanks for your time!

A: I have. It's very common. My advice is it's time to make a change!
