<r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned we’re currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we’ve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we’ll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* It’s web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We’d love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: it’s difficult to learn; it’s error-prone; and it’s time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. We’d like to make changes more quickly. You’ve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

We’re designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we’ll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We’d like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? We’ll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you’ll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn’t going to be easy for everyone, so we’ll assist communities that want help (i.e. we’ll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

We’re in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we’ll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don’t have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention… we’re also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We’ve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we’ll keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorial–thankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we’ll be grappling with together–changes to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We’ll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.

[Called it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/64s5z2/is_css_customization_going_away/)

I don't support this.

Many subreddits are different, and have different goals or CSS tweaks. I don't see how this will actually be considered a working replacement? For example if 50 subreddits use CSS to add extra buttons like "Read FAQ" below "Submit a new link" but the other 4000+ subreddits don't, would the admins actually give this dev time to implement? Are the admins actually going to implement every use case we moderators use CSS for to accomplish functionality? I don't see that being feasible. If not, then this is simple a loss in functionality for many many subreddits.

So what, we're just homogenizing Reddit now? And I'm not talking about the visuals, but functionality.

I can never see one blanket "theme" system/style to cover *all* subreddits working as they used to.

CSS has accomplished:

* Functionality: /r/Overwatch has subreddit filters
* Functionality: /r/Dota2 has a list of current livestreams and their # of viewers
* UX: /r/videos has a list of rules where on hover it expands out to explain each rule
* Functionality: /r/Minecraft has a list of server status (icons) on sidebar
* UX: /r/Hearthstone has notices & links on the top banner
* Personality: /r/ffxiv has various [CSS Easter Eggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/50f41p/claps_for_the_moderators/?ref=search_posts) to give it a bit more personality
* Functionality: /r/Starcraft has a "verified user" system
* UX: /r/Guildwars2 increased the the size of "message the moderators" to make it stand out more
* UX: /r/ffxi has a small tooltip if a user hasn't set a user flair yet
* UX: /r/DarkSouls2 has related subreddits linked on the sidebar with images instead of text
* Personality: /r/mildlyinfuriating's joke where it slightly rotates "random" comment threads
* Functionality: /r/ClashOfClans not only has a list of livestreams, but thumbnail previews of each
* UX: /r/DarkSouls3 has a reminder when hovering over the downvote button
* Personality: /r/StarWars has quote popups when you upvote
* UX: /r/pcmasterrace has changed the "report" link to red
* UX: /r/explainlikeimfive has custom colored link flair icons
* Personality: /r/mylittlepony has countless emotes
* Personality: /r/onepiece has a scrolling banner (which can be paused)
* UX: /r/FinalFantasy has green background stickies to make them stand out
* Personality: /r/mildlyinteresting has a moving gauge on sidebar
* Functionality: /r/IASIP has a top menu
* UX: /r/DoctorWho has a light red box on sidebar for new users to read
* UX: /r/gallifrey disables the PM link on "Created by" so users focus on modmail

At the minimum, I see this as taking away the personality each subreddit has. We also lose the ability to control and improve UX, considering the admins have been exceptionally slow to improve any UX (even something like link flair).

To be clear, I'm not upset by the fact that the time we spent on our CSS is being made useless. I'm upset that we'll be losing functionality and *individual subreddit personality*.

[EDIT] Fellow mods, please remember to be civil here. I may not agree with this decision about CSS, but I still respect the admins and all the hard work they do.

<u/spez>: Just replying here so you know that I've seen it.

These are all great examples of cool stuff folks have done with CSS, and there are many more.

My goal today is to affirm that while CSS isn't the technology of the future for us, subreddit customization is important, and we're going to continue to evolve it.

I doubt I can convince you today with anything I say, but we're going to move forward, test carefully, and I hope you'll be a part of the process.
