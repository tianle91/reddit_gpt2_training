<r/ModSupport>: Can't get rid of frozen account's comment in modqueue. No response from admins for 2 weeks. What the heck

Comment in question: https://i.imgur.com/DoX6HKc.png

Since it's a locked account approving, removing, or ignoring reports on this comment doesn't work.  It has been in modqueue for over 2 weeks now and we have had 0 on-topic responses from the admins (the only response was to talk to the mods of the subreddit to get our comment approved).  I'd settle for a "Thanks for letting us know.  We can't do anything because reasons" response, but have received nothing.  We've replied to our messages to them a couple times to bring it back up.  Still nothing.

Is this the kind of response we should expect from the admins going forward? <u/spez>: Should be fixed now. Will dig in and see what happened. I think there was a miscommunication of what the problem actually was.
