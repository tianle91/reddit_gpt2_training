<r/electronicmusic>: I am GRiZ, a saxophone wielding electronic funk and soul producer - I'm here to talk about music, life, and whatever else you want to talk about... AMA!

I am originally from the Metro-Detroit area but you can currently find me on tour.
We're comin' at you live today from Nashville, TN!! 

Here to discuss and celebrate the release of my new album "Good Will Prevail"
You can download it here for free: www.GoodWillPrevailAlbum.com

When I'm not performing or writing music - I enjoy cooking, yoga, skateboarding, graphic design, watching the extended works of hayao miyazak, ice cream, and a bunch of other random shit.  So go ahead and ask me anything and let's have some fun!

If you want to come party with my friends and I, get tickets to one of my upcoming shows --> www.GoodWillPrevailTour.com

 <u/spez>: Yo! No question, but whenever I absolutely need to get people get up and dance, I put on GRiZ. My friends role their eyes at me by this point... but then they get up and dance. You're responsible for a lot of fun times. Thanks!
