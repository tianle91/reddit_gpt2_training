<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later.

<u/IT_guys_rule>: Okay here's a dark secret question: Can Super Mods and Admins see user's IP addresses if they have multiple accounts? Can you see the main account of a throwaway? 

Edit: I don't know what a super mod is either guys, I just figured there were Mods then there were MODS!!! 

<u/spez>: Yes, but we throw away IPs after 100 days.

> Can you see the main account of a throwaway?

Sort of. No one's looking. If they happen to share an IP, it's possible, but many IPs, for example at a college, have many hundreds of accounts on them.

edit: I should clarify. There is no such thing as a "super mod," and only select Reddit employees have access to IPs.
