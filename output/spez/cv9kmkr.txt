<r/announcements>: Marty Weiner, Reddit CTO, back to CTO all the things

Aaaarr-arahahhraarrrr.  That’s Wookie for “Hello again, hope you’re doing well, AMAE (ask me anything engineering), aaarrhhuu-uhh”,

I’m back to chat [as promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3hs3v4/im_marty_weiner_the_new_reddit_cto/).  It’s already been a month and a wild ride the whole time.  I’ve really gotten to know this amazing team and where we need to head (apparently there’s lots to do here… who knew?).

Here’s a few updates:

* I’m still [surprisingly photogenic](http://imgur.com/G7G9BRK)
* R2’s legs [have made progress](http://i.imgur.com/zz0OeFz.jpg) (glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he’d agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely "super highest priority".

Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.

I have about 1.17 hours now to answer questions, and then I'm going and playing with my wee ones.

Edit: Running to my train.  If I can get a seat, I'll finish off some in-flight answers.  XOXOXO, Marty

<u/spez>: The big feature we lack right now is keyword targeting, and perhaps more importantly, anti-keyword targeting. Right now, advertisers have very little control over who actually sees their ads because they can only target at the community level, and they're very concerned about brand safety. Basically, they want to say, I want my ad to show around conversations about *this* topic, but not *that* topic.

As far as tracking, we will continue to serve ads in an iframe, which dramatically limits what information an advertiser sees (e.g. they don't see what urls you're on), and we will provide ways to opt-out (more than we offer now).

Philosophically, I'm as paranoid as anyone about advertisers knowing what I'm up to online–it's a common characteristic of most Reddit employees, in fact–so that guides our thinking.
