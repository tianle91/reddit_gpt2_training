<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/110011001100>: EDIT: I deleted this comment, but the crux of the question was if Reddit still has a non negotiation policy, and if so, why

<u/spez>: Yes, we still use it. We used it at Hipmunk as well. There are a handful of reasons for it:

* It's more fair. We're paying people for their level of work, not their ability to negotiate.
* I'd rather start our relationship happy that we found a good fit rather than tense from a negotiation.
* I get no enjoyment getting someone for cheap, but the hire gets a lot of disappointment.
* It's easier. We look up your level in the chart, and that's it. We don't have to do any internal negotiation either.

Every company is different. Some will lowball you because they think they have to. Some will lowball you because they're assholes. Some will come in really high because they have tons of money. We make our best offer first. Take the advice for what it is, but know that it only applies in some situations.
