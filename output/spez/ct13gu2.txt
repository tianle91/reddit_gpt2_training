<r/GamerGhazi>: All I am saying is, Give Spez a Chance

[deleted] <u/madhaus>: Wonder if u/spez is a fan of the old Hewlett-Packard practice of "Managing By Walking Around." If he is, he really should be at least checking out these posts that namedrop him.  Unlimited Free Speech enables harassment, bullying, and Tyranny of the Majority (either in karma, in post quantity, or in gaming the system). The question is, does Huffman know this and not care, or are these concepts that never occurred to him since Reddit was created for bros like him so by definition I SEE NO PROBLEM HERE. <u/spez>: Yeah, I see 'em. Most of them, at least (I won't get to read all 5k I received on day 1).
