<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/jpham1209>: Hey! 
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in CSE and during the first two years I never really knew what I wanted to do in this field so I didn't care about my studies as much until I learned about web development. I've been reviewing data structures and algorithms in Java, retaking classes, just started doing side projects, and went to a hackathon recently to work on a group project. I'm a graduating next year and I'm worried that I won't find a job because my gpa isn't great. I also haven't had a summer internship. 
So my questions are: 

Do you have any advice on what I can work on to improve myself? 

Do companies look at gpa first to determine if I even receive an interview?

I find it's often best to give yourself a project. It helps focus your attention. Pick a product you like (Reddit?) and see if you can build it yourself.

I can't speak for others, but if you don't put your GPA on your resume, I'm not going to ask.
