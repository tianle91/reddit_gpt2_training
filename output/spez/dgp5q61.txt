<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators! <u/fecak>: Hey u/Spez - mod here and just wanted to say thanks in advance for doing this with us. Enjoy our readers *and their requests for internships*... <u/spez>: My pleasure! Thanks for having me.
