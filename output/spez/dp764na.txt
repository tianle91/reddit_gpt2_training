<r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

Annnnnnd in other news:

In case you didn’t catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, we’re running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!

This weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1251).

Finally, today we’re kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, I’m no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I’d love some ideas to keep me busy.

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers! <u/daveime>: > Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks.

Are either of these opt-out?

The new profile pages I've seen leave me lost and confused, but I'll be damned if I'm tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login. <u/spez>: 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now. <u/throwmeintothewall>: > easier-to-read

Allow me to disagree.  <u/spez>: Permission granted. <u/IranianGenius>: The only use I see for profile pages is [advertisement](/u/IranianGenius) which doesn't make sense for users like me. It's just a way to promote yourself. And I don't even *like* myself.

Edit: I don't need gold. Instead consider subscribing to my [patreon](/r/iraniangenius) which is currently free because I'm not worth your money. <u/spez>: Ah, well let me share another perspective.

A really important target user of this feature is the original content creator. Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.

Skip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.

I was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.

Hope this gives a little more context to what we're trying to build.
