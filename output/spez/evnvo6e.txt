Title: Will I get stuck if I accept this first job opportunity?

Body: My internship seems to be leading into an offer for full-time after graduation. I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing, but I'm nervous about just accepting the first opportunity that comes my way. Will I get stuck and have fewer opportunities if I just accept this first job?

I know this question is vague, but I appreciate any advice you have for me.

Q: What do you think?
A: >I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing It's hard to find this, so I'd give strong consideration to staying. And what does it mean to be stuck? You'd only be stuck if this was the only job available, and if this is the only job available, you have no options anyway.
