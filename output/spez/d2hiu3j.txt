<r/ModSupport>: A few updates on what has been keeping us busy

Hi All,

I want to give you all an update with the things that are keeping us busy, and hopefully as a result, making you less busy:

* **Spam**: Last quarter we saw a huge increase in spam, including a handful of heavy attacks. We diverted resources to combat this, and we have made quite a bit of progress, lowering user reported spam by over 60% from its high point last quarter. We still have plenty of work to do, but we are making steady progress. Removing as spam or reporting as such are still the most effective ways to help.

* **Account Take-Overs** (ATOs): In response to our improved spam-fighting measures, the bad-guys have been targeting existing accounts, compromising them for the purpose of spamming and vote cheating. We are fighting ATOs on the engineering side, but ATOs also create a burden on our community team to notify affected users, send password reset emails, etc. We are working on automating the notification and recovery processes to free up our community managers. The root cause of the issue is poor passwords. Please use strong and unique passwords.

* **Support Backlog**: Because of the aforementioned issues, our community team is swamped with support tickets. We are doing a good job keeping up with the incoming flow, but we do have a backlog that is taking time to work through. We are sorry for any delays. The good news is we have a number of new people joining the team over the next few weeks that will help.

* **Modmail**: I am happy to report that we finally have a team dedicated to working on a new system for moderator mail. To this point, we have tried a number of approaches and have had a handful of false starts, but we have not made the sort of progress we would like. The current system is a series of hacks built on an old code base, and because of this, we have decided to build modmail as a new, separate system. This will allow us to develop it without disrupting your current workflows. We know this is where you spend a lot of your time, and we are working hard to make it more effective.

We appreciate all you do for Reddit as moderators, and we appreciate seeing the questions you ask in this community. We are particularly thankful for those of you who jump in and help the other moderators here and elsewhere.

â€“ The Reddit Team <u/roionsteroids>: When can we expect the new modmail? Closer to a month or a year? <u/spez>: We have a goal, but I'm not sharing it lest we miss it, and you all [take your disappointment out on me](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-06/15/5/enhanced/webdr06/anigif_enhanced-19641-1434361510-6.gif).
