<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. <u/ElagabalusRex>: Do you ever think about unbanning every single user just to see the chaos it would create? <u/spez>: Yes, actually. There are probably users who were accidentally banned for spamming, but in reality they were just sharing an IP with a spammer. Now that our anti-spam efforts are so much better, I'd like to unban all old spammers and see what happens.
