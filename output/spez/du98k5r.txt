<r/politics>: I’m Steve Bullock, the first Governor to protect net neutrality. AMA.

 I'm the governor of Montana. I'm also a husband, father of three, runner and former attorney general. I'm a big fan of actually working with people to get things done while Washington, DC is stuck in constant gridlock.
 
So when the FCC repealed net neutrality rules, I decided to see if there was anything states could do to ensure a free and open internet for everyone. Turns out there is – and I became the first governor in the country to sign an Executive Order protecting net neutrality: https://twitter.com/GovernorBullock/status/955509233293733888 
 
Here’s the Executive Order: http://governor.mt.gov/Portals/16/docs/2018EOs/EO-03-2018_Net%20Freedom.pdf?ver=2018-01-22-122048-023
 
This isn’t rocket science. Your state can do this too. Here’s a template: http://governor.mt.gov/Portals/16/EO_Net%20Freedom_TEMPLATE.docx?ver=201 

It's time to stop talking about protecting net neutrality and actually do something about it.

UPDATE: Thanks so much - my hour is up and my staff is insisting I go back to governing. There's still some great questions here and I might be following up with you all soon! <u/spez>: Thank you for fighting! Net Neutrality is something we strongly believe in at Reddit.
