Title: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Body: Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

Q: What do you think?
A: Hi Spez, Thank you for doing this AMA! I am one year away from graduation, what can I do to make myself extra competitive compared to most other candidates to land great job offers (like Reddit) ? Also what do you enjoy most about your job?

A: Write as much code as possible and as broadly as possible. Games, AI, databases, it's all useful eventually. What I love most about my job is that I never want for a sense of purpose. My work matters.
