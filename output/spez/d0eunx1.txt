<r/ModSupport>: Amazon links being flagged as SPAM.

I have seen several Amazon links show up in the SPAM view and I am trying to figure out why.  The links do not have "tag=" which I understand indicate referral links.  I have checked AutoMod config and there is nothing there to trigger it.  The Automod is pretty sparse as is.

Here are two links that got thrown into SPAM.

My best guess is another Mod though "ref=" meant referral and tagged them some time ago.  And since the system "learns" it remembered it?  I don't know if that is the case, nor how to check or fix it if it is.

Or maybe it is something else I missed?

<u/spez>: Ironically, this post was also banned. Someone else can probably chime in with the exact cause.

<u/love_the_heat>: Hi spez! Whatcha working on today? 

<u/spez>: We had a board meeting yesterday, so I'm catching up on a few days of email. My two big priorities are hiring engineers and instilling a greater sense of urgency to get things done.
