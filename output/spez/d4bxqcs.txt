<r/announcements>: Let’s all have a town hall about r/all

Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

u: I'm off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I'll check back in a couple hours. <u/MockDeath>: Having a filter for nsfw for all or a separate /r/all would be nice.

Many of us slack at work and brows reddit, at least speaking for myself it would be nice if there was less to no NSFW on a version of /r/all.

-edit- I appreciate the advice, I actually use RES everywhere but work. but I do browse reddit at lunch and breaks.. and occasionally not lunch and breaks. But if you are the frontpage of the internet, new users will not know how to filter things. <u/spez>: Agreed.

At least I can claim it's work.
