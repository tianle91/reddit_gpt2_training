<r/modnews>: Making it easier to host events

Hi Mods,

We’ve been working on a few things to make it easier for you to host events for your communities. Over the last week, we’ve invited a few mod teams (see comments for the list) to start trying them out as a beta, so we wanted to let the rest of you know what’s up as well.

# Why are we doing this?

Many people come to Reddit during events—whether it's an AMA, a TV show premiere, a sports finale, or [another newsworthy development](https://redditblog.com/2018/07/12/thanosdidnothingwrong/). The problem is that it’s hard for users to find these events (both when they’re happening and when the next one is occurring) and even harder for mods to host and manage them using our existing tools.

Solutions like AutoModerator scheduler aren’t super accessible or easy to use for mods who aren't already AutoMod wizards, and other hacks communities have used to manage events have shown us where our tools could be improved.

# So, what are the features?

We're building a suite of mod-only features to solve these problems:

* **Event post metadata**: This gives mods the ability to [add start/end date/time information to posts](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izc0y/add_event_data/). Users can see the start/end time from listings pages and on the posts themselves and “follow” the events. In the coming weeks, following the event will send them an app notification when the event starts.
* **Post submission scheduling:** This gives mods the ability to schedule when a post should be submitted. The first version of post scheduling will be event-focused with options to submit now or submit at event start time only.
* **Post collections:** This gives mods the ability to [group posts together in a community “collection”](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izc6i/collection_mod_flow/). Users will be able to view and switch between [posts within a collection easily](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izbxn/collection_demo/). They can share a collection URL, which will automatically direct them to the in-progress/most recent event post (e.g., if I made a collection of pre-, live- and post- game threads for last week’s Notre Dame v Wake Forest college football game and you clicked the collection URL, it would open the post- game thread. If I clicked that same link when the game was in progress, I’d see the live- game thread). That said, you can still easily get back to the other posts in the collection as well.

We’ve broken event metadata, post scheduling, and post collections into separate features because we believe they have broader utility than the Events-specific use case and want to give mods flexibility as you test these out. Our goal for each of these is to reduce the amount of time/effort you put into hosting an event on Reddit and to make it easier for more mods to help host. As we evaluate these features, we may decide to invest more in some and less in others. Your feedback will help us prioritize this and we’ll keep you posted along the way.

# I want to try it out, how can I?

We’re testing these features out with a few mod teams and going to launch a series of improvements over the next month or so. For now, you can [join our waitlist](https://goo.gl/forms/dgs8p2jD73ZahhIi1). We’ll enable more mod teams periodically.

Thanks,

UPDATED 3/14:

We've made a few Event and Collections endpoints available for our beta communities to start trying out and giving us feedback on. You can read more about these APIs here, https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/.  <u/likeafox>: Yes we like this. Can you talk about different use cases you have envisioned for the post collections tool? Will the collections have an exposed public API?  <u/0perspective>: For different use cases, we're really excited to see the creative use cases the communities come up with. Some idea we've talked about internally a few

\-- All the discussion threads for seasons 2 of Game of Thrones

\-- Best 401k advice

\-- This weeks best OC

\-- Chronicling the developing news like (Hurricane Florence)

\-- Eventually we could see mod teams use this for megathreads.

**What ideas do you have?**  


As for API access, it's something we're considering this during the beta. **How would you use API access?** <u/shiruken>: Back when /r/science hosted AMAs, collections would have been perfect for organizing our themed AMA weeks. <u/spez>: We hope so. r/science AMAs were one of the inspirations for this feature. The idea is you can create a landing page for an AMA days before the event to build up excitement, and then bring everybody back at the same time for the actual event.
