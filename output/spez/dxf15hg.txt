<r/TheoryOfReddit>: Would CT (and related subreddits) be banned if they still existed today?

In light of \/u/spez's recent comments in regards to Reddit's position of sub-reddits which openly post racist content, numerous news outlets have taken notice of this and cited it whilst citing the reactions of various reddit users.

This gets redundant after a while, but the point is that this viewpoint has been noted by no shortage of news outlets both large and small. It is also a complete about-face from [spez's own original position 9 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/)

> ? This isn't any change in policy: we've always banned hate speech, and we always will. It's not up for debate.

> You can bitch and moan all you like, but me and my team aren't going to be responsible for encouraging behaviors that lead to hate.

However, it is more consistent with his recent views such as ["...the last thing we're going to do is take their voice away."](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx/)

At one point in time, reddit played host to [one of the internet's largest known collection of hate-specific forums online.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversial_Reddit_communities&oldid=836344847#The_"Chimpire") Over the years, one or two related subreddits would be banned at a time, but it wasn't until August 2015's banning of CT that the entire network of participating subreddits was effectively banned.

With the present observed shift in ideals by Reddit and its present leadership, assuming that it still existed today, would CT be banned? <u/spez>: Yes. Since we banned CT in 2015, we’ve updated our policies against harassment, bullying, and violence, all of which would be grounds for dismissal for that community.

Furthermore, the teams who make and enforce these decisions are much more robust. 

CT was frustrating as the time because we didn’t have the policies and processes in place, but they wouldn’t last long today.
