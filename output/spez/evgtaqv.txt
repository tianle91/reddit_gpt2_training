<r/BarefootRunning>: Can barefoot running cause you to develop arches?

[deleted]

<u/spez>: To echo many people here, yes, that’s been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. 

Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). 

I find that simply walking is not enough. It’s running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits.
