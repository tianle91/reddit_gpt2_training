<r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of "harm"
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

update: I'm out of here, everyone. Thank you so much for the feedback. I found this very productive. I'll check back later.

<u/justcool393>: Hi everyone answering these questions. I have a "few" questions that I, like probably most of reddit would like answers to. Like a recent AMA I asked questions in, the bold will be the meat of the question, and the non-bolded will be context. ***If you don't know an answer to a question, say so, and do so directly!*** Honesty is very much appreciated. With that said, here goes.

#Content Policy


1. **What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech, but not harassing?** Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones. Are users, and by extension subreddits, allowed to behave in this way, or will this be banned or censored?

2. **What is the policy regarding, well, [these subreddits][5]?** These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole. These usually come up during AskReddit threads of "where would you not go" or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned. *(Edit: WatchPeopleDie shouldn't be included and is definitely not as bad as the others. [See here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/z/ct5sk10))*

3. **What actually is the harassment policy?** Yes, I know the definition that's practically copypasta from the announcement, but could we have examples? You don't have to define a hard rule, in fact, it'd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering, but it'd be helpful to have an example.

4. **What are your thoughts on some people's interpretation of the rules as becoming a [safe-space][6]?** A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this, and as such are not happy about it. I personally didn't read the rules that way, but I can see how it may be interpreted that way.

5. **Do you have any plans to update the rules page?** It, at the moment, has 6 rules, and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule 5, which is at best reaching in regards to it.

6. **What is the best way to report harassment?** For example, should we use /r/reddit.com's modmail or the contact@reddit.com email? How long should we wait before bumping a modmail, for example? 

7. **Who is allowed to report harassment?** Say I'm a moderator, and decide to check a user's history and see they've followed around another user to 20 different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot. Should I report it to the admins? 

#Brigading 

1. **In regards to subreddits for mocking another group, what is the policy on them?** Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever, such as /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/SRSsucks, the "Badpire", /r/Buttcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit. SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there. 

2. **What are the current plans to address brigading?** Will reddit ever support NP (and maybe implement it) or implement another way to curb brigading? This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits.

3. **Is this [a good definition of brigading][3], and if not, what is it?** Many mods and users can't give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it. This forces them to resort to in SubredditDrama's case, banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads, or in ShitRedditSays' case, not do anything at all.

1. **What is spam?** Like yes, we know what obvious spam is, but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content. 
2. **Regarding the ["Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech" comment][1], how do you feel about [this][2], [this][7], [this][8] or [this][9]?** I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now, but it's not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions, especially during the /r/creepshots debacle, even with the literal words "bastion of free speech".

3. **How do you plan to implement the new policy?** If the policy is substantially more restrictive, such as combating racism or whatnot, I think you'll have a problem in the long run, because there is just way too much content on reddit, and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently. Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned.
4. **Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA, and if so, what was the point of it?** It seems like from the announcement, you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit, and this has made some people understandably upset.
5. **Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events?** I know this has been stressful, but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat (sometimes untrue, but whatever) experiences and whatnot. I don't think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself, but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team (and former team to be quite honest) are quite concerning.

<u/spez>: I’ll try

Content Policy

1. Harboring unpopular ideologies is not a reason for banning.

2. (Based on the titles alone) Some of these should be banned since they are inciting violence, others should be separated.

3. This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someone’s inbox with PMs saying, “Kill yourself” is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

4. It’s an impossible concept to achieve

5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). We’ll be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

Brigading

1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but we’ll keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

1. The content creators one is an issue I’d like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it’s submitted with a script, it’s spam.

2. While we didn’t *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadn’t done before. Although I wasn’t at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isn’t too difficult.

4. No, we’ve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that we’ll incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.

5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that I’m here, I’m looking forward to moving forward and improving things.


<u/Senray>: >The content creators one is an issue I’d like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it’s submitted with a script, it’s spam.

Uh, this would ban all bots

OKAY THANKS FOR THE REPLIES I  GET IT

<u/spez>: I meant specifically in regard to "content creators." For example, it used to be common that a site would write a script that automatically spammed multiple subreddits every time they wrote something.
