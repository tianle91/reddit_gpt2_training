<r/changelog>: Renaming "sticky posts" to "announcements"

Now that some time has been passed since [we opened up sticky posts to more types of content](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3d7i0q/moderators_you_can_now_have_two_stickies_in_your/), we've noticed that for the most part stickies are used for community-centric announcements and event-specific mega-threads.  As such, we've decided to refine the feature and explicitly start referring to them as "announcements."  

The mechanics around announcements will be quite similar to stickies with the constraint that the sticky post must be either:

 * a text post
 * a link to live threads
 * a link to wiki pages

~~Additionally, the author of the post must be a moderator at the time of the announcement.~~  [Redacted.  See Edit 2!]

Then changes can be found [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/ba9dc13eb579c3e8f90b41cecd460961cebeb91b).

**Edit**: [fixed an unstickying bug](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/599628a6a5bb97f592cdf9f9e855fda569f00c7c)

**Edit 2**: Since we don't want to remove the ability for mods to mark/highlight existing threads as officially supported, [the mod authorship requirement has been removed.](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/7e5f4a415dd0d7d98328dbde71c14c32479aa979) <u/D0cR3d>: Edit: See admins edit but they [removed](https://github.com/allthefoxes/reddit/commit/7e5f4a415dd0d7d98328dbde71c14c32479aa979) the requirement that for sticking a self that it had to be made by a mod.

So what happens to regular sticky posts. A few of my subreddits use sticky posts as a gathering of information. Can only mods make sticky aka announcement posts? What if a news info like E3 for the gaming subs, a user makes a post first, and we want to honor that by making a collective discussion thread? Are we not able to do that and we as mods would have to create our own announcement post just to sticky it?

Examples when we would sticky a users post:

1. They create a really detailed helpful post with information, and we want to direct users to it
2. Mods are asleep and a user gets the drop on a game update, or E3 coverage, or some other bit of information. We like to reduce redundant threads, so direct discussion to a single thread and make this a stickied megathread.
3. An important new story breaks out (current event) and the mods want to sticky that for visibility. 

Users kinda get angry if mods remove threads to make their own, especially when users get a big drop on the mods in terms of time. Not exactly the best PR for us to remove a post and make our own just so we can sticky it to get users attention.

So what are we supposed to do? Make a announcement thread with a link to the users thread and lock our thread just as a redirect? <u/spez>: These are good points. We're hearing the feedback and will discuss.

edit: we removed the moderator rule.
