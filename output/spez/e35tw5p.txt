<r/inthesoulstone>: An update on going private

We would like to formally apologise to everyone r/inthesoulstone for the lack of communication & delay regarding going private.

We know you are pissed and you have every right to be. You all have been demanding to go private for so long now. And no, we haven’t forgotten about it. We admit, there have been quite a few hiccups along the way but the good news is we've managed to solve most of the problems, except for one. The Reddit API limits the amount of approved users to 200 per hour. In theory, that would take around 40 days to manually approve 230,000 souls. In addition, the mod team would also have to clear and archive 230k+ modmails, each of it being a notification that the user is now an approved submitter in the subreddit. We would rather take a quicker path.

Quite a few people here have wrongly assumed that manually approving 230k+ souls shouldn’t be a problem. If that’s the case, let me make it absolutely clear that we have a mod team consisting of 8 people, with each of them having their own personal lives to attend to. It’s just not practically possible, yet we are still considering it as an option but of the last resort.

We have been trying to get in touch with the Reddit admins regarding our API issue but haven’t yet received any response in return.

We are also aware of the fact that the bot has stopped responding to the “!snapme” command and we're working on fixing it.

At last, If anyone here has any other ideas they would like to bounce off or any solutions they would like to share, please do let us know in the comments below.

 \###Update  u/spez:  "I believe the infra team is swamped with Official Business right now. I’ll bring it up when they come up for air."

/u/Spez I've come to bargain. <u/spez>: I believe the infra team is swamped with Official Business right now. I’ll bring it up when they come up for air.
