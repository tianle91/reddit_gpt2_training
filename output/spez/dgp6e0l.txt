<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators! <u/cybercuzco>: As someone who also made the transition from engineering to management at one point, how is it going for you?  How did you handle the stress of having to fire people? <u/spez>: It's going ok. I've never been a great manager. These days I manage executives, who by nature are self-managing.

One thing that helped me is acknowledging my strengths and weaknesses, and playing to the former while minimizing the latter. I'm a good mentor and coach, but I can also be scattered and aloof. I still love working with beginners, but I'm not great a project managing.

When I fire people, I try to get myself into a mental state where I want to do it. Sometimes it's because the person who we're letting go will actually be happier elsewhere. Other times, I think about the time and stress I'm saving someone else on the team.
