Title: Just want to let everyone know that no matter what problems youâ€™re having in life it does get better.

Body: I recently went through a rough patch in my life and i was really sad about what happened but now i realized it was for the best. So i just want to let everyone know that they matter and that it does get better.

Q: What do you think?
A: Whenever I go through a rough patch, I try to remember all the rough patches I've been through already, and all the high points and happy memories in between them. Then I remind myself that every rough patch has so far eventually been followed by good times and that whatever it is, this too shall pass. And it does.
