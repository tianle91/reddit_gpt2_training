<r/ModSupport>: 1+ Month with no admin response on ban evaders

I mod a few trading subs and we have significant issues with ban evaders and malicious impersonators. Initially the admins were very responsive. I provide a list of known ban evaders and impersonators and I usually got feedback within 24 hours or a couple of days at the most. It began to taper off a couple of months ago with response times getting slower and slower until finally nothing. I've bumped the last reply I got from them with new information and requests to reply but have gotten nothing for over a month. 

I'd like to know if they're not responding to ban evasion anymore or if there's some sort of policy change that they just haven't disclosed. A month with no response though is frustrating and I'd like to know what's going on.  <u/beezwacks>: We have had the same difficulty in /r/NASCAR.  <u/spez>: Please PM the details, and I will investigate.

edit: I think I figured it out. Sorry for the delay. Let me know if you have more trouble with him/them.
