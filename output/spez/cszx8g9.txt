<r/IAmA>: I am Steve Huffman, the new CEO of reddit. AMA.

Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka spez, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions!

<u/Xephyron>: Please don't do them weekly. Maybe monthly or bi-monthly. 

What's your plan on policing vote-brigading in the future? Do you have some way to automatically track vote brigades and people taking part in them?

Ok, you're the boss, Xephryon.

> Do you have some way to automatically track vote brigades and people taking part in them?

Yeah, we do. It's existed for a long time. Maybe it broke after I left. We used to put a lot of effort into identifying large groups of people who were trying to undermine the community.

<u/Infamously_Unknown>: You said elsewhere you're against shadowbanning of real users. Given that brigading is currently mostly countered by shadowbans, how do you plan to punish them instead?

<u/spez>: Undermine them with technology, of course.
