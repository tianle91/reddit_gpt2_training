<r/changelog>: Renaming "sticky posts" to "announcements"

Now that some time has been passed since [we opened up sticky posts to more types of content](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3d7i0q/moderators_you_can_now_have_two_stickies_in_your/), we've noticed that for the most part stickies are used for community-centric announcements and event-specific mega-threads.  As such, we've decided to refine the feature and explicitly start referring to them as "announcements."  

The mechanics around announcements will be quite similar to stickies with the constraint that the sticky post must be either:

 * a text post
 * a link to live threads
 * a link to wiki pages

~~Additionally, the author of the post must be a moderator at the time of the announcement.~~  [Redacted.  See Edit 2!]

Then changes can be found [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/ba9dc13eb579c3e8f90b41cecd460961cebeb91b).

**Edit**: [fixed an unstickying bug](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/599628a6a5bb97f592cdf9f9e855fda569f00c7c)

**Edit 2**: Since we don't want to remove the ability for mods to mark/highlight existing threads as officially supported, [the mod authorship requirement has been removed.](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/7e5f4a415dd0d7d98328dbde71c14c32479aa979) <u/[deleted]>: [deleted] <u/spez>: Removed the mod-only rule. Thanks for the feedback.
