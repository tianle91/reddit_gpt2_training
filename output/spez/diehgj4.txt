<r/programming>: The Evolution of Code Deploys at Reddit

<u/KeyserSosa>: The *original* original deployment scheme was pretty much "\^C the reddit process running in screen on the server."  

At least I hope it was in screen...

<u/spez>: It was not.

<u/raldi>: I thought the _original_ was that you would type some new Lisp into the REPL that was serving the site, wasn't it? 

And sometimes you even remembered to save it to a file later?

<u/spez>: That's right. We ran Reddit out of a long-living CMUCL process. Instead of reloading everything, I (I'm always hesitant to use I instead of We, but it was really just me doing the dev at the time) updated the process one function at a time by pasting in newly updated code. Because of this, the instance of Reddit running in production wasn't necessarily documented in any specific code. It resembled more a well-aged cheese cultureâ€”impossible to reproduce.
