<r/ModSupport>: Question about the recent change to record data on clicks

Will this data (or some anonymized version of it) be available to mods? This would be really helpful in determining whether a post is actually doing well or if it's being manipulated.  <u/spez>: Right now, it's just in a test for a small sample of users. It's something we could consider, but we would do that in the context of considering the privacy implications as well.
