<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! <u/Plorp>: Is there any chance you guys are ever going to take a look at the [10% rule for self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and revise it a bit to make it more fair to creative people who legitimately have something to share to the reddit community? I ask because I know that rule is turning a lot of creative people away from reddit because recently any posts about what they're currently working on tend to get deleted. There's a difference between spamming 100 links to a blog nobody cares about full of ads, and say, an indie game developer who makes 1 game every couple of years and wants to tell people about it and answer questions, but doesnt necessarily want to have to post 10 advice animals in the mean time?

This isn't my main account, its just the one I post on the most because I don't really want reddit posts on my other account showing up in google searches for my name. SO I just use the other one to talk about stuff I'm working on (not spam, one post once in a while and when they don't get deleted for self promotion they get upvoted a lot and people seem to enjoy them and I answer questions and participate in the discussions). Or I used to at least. It's been difficult lately.

At least there seems to be quite a double standard where anyone SUPER FAMOUS AND POPULAR already gets a free pass for promoting their works on reddit (celebrity AMAs and people like JimKB), whereas all the little guys who can't afford massive marketing campaigns for their works get shunned away and basically told that reddit doesn't value their work. I'm [not the only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5UjfCZUzg) who thinks this.

If you want specific complaints about the 10% rule its:  
- comments don't count  
- posts from many years ago before this rule was strict count against it  
- posts in subreddits that WANT original content and posts from creators (like /r/gamedev) count against you in all other subreddits  
- posts on alternate accounts don't count (I like keeping my "business" account separated since I don't want people to easily see like, my political opinions and stuff)  
- the rule just encourages people to either spam up advice animals, or lie about being the author ("my friend just made..."), or use sockpuppet accounts. All of these seem less valuable to me than letting authors be honest about it, and it makes reddit a worse place as a result.  
- A spambot or true spammer can get around a rule like "90% of posts must not be self promotion" with bots and scripts and proxies and sockpuppets really easily, so this rule just ends up targeting honest creatives who are proud of what they made and want to share it with a site they visit every day. <u/spez>: It just came up yesterday. We all agreed it was dumb. Stay tuned.
