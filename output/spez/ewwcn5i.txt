<r/CasualConversation>: Reddit is such a rollercoaster for me.

I keep being happy then angry then sad, because of the posts and the variaty of subs that im subscribed for. Sometimes i think about quitting the ones that makes me mad, but i also think that this is just closing my eyes to reality and just wanting to see nice things idk. What you guys think?

<u/spez>: I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features.
