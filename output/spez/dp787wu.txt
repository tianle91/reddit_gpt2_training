<r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

Annnnnnd in other news:

Finally, today we’re kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, I’m no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I’d love some ideas to keep me busy.

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers! <u/vinsfeld08>: Over the years, Reddit has grown from small groups of people submitting content to subs and sharing with each other in a series of available public forums to a number one site on the internet. Now, in addition to private parties sharing what they love, we have corporations, political figures, and media outlets using this as a social media platform not just as a means of contracting with fans/customers/constituents, but as a means of pushing an agenda. While the web traffic is appealing, I have to ask: Is this in line with the original vision for Reddit? Is this how we can expect the future to be, or is there hope of some change to the way Reddit is used by those with money to influence the content on this site? <u/spez>: The original vision for Reddit was quite small. We wanted to build a place where people could find new and interesting things online. Specifically, we wanted the site to have the community feel of Slashdot but with content curated by users.

As Reddit has grown, so has our vision. Reddit provides human connection and belonging, for which we believe people have a fundamental need. People come to Reddit to stay informed, to laugh, to learn, to argue, for support, to talk about freaky sex stuff... Reddit means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we want to provide our service for everyone on the planet.

Of course, the increase in size means we attract people who want to exploit us. We at Reddit Inc will do our best to prevent this, and the greater Reddit community will fight it as well.

Reddit is the most human place on the Internet, we'll fight to preserve this as hard as we can.
