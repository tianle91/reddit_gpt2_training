<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! <u/[deleted]>: [deleted] <u/spez>: I alluded to this in another comment. In addition to better tools, making it easier for new communities to grow will help, a new front page algorithm is a big first step in this direction.

update: I can't tell if everyone disagrees, or if I wasn't clear, so I'll try again. I think the best solution to overzealous mods is to make it easier to create new communities under new leadership. The mods basically have one blunt tool right now, automoderator, and not a lot of time. Our first step is to provide better tooling for mods to enforce their own rules, and better defenses against abusive users. When all of this is combined, I expect far fewer abuses.
