<r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

Hello again,

Now that it’s far enough into the year that we’re all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I’d give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we’re working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven’t tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we’re still working on these features and we’ll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you’d like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I’m particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I’m serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.

<u/RetroSplicer>: I just want the option of seeing only legacy profiles. The new ones are so clunky and ugly. 

<u/spez>: Yes, we're adding an option for the legacy profiles while we finish the new ones.

The team is all hands on deck finishing the redesign, which means we've slowed on the new profiles. Our plan is to pause the rollout, give an option to use the legacy version, and finish the profiles with the redesign, taking into account the feedback we've received so far.



<u/shhhhquiet>: > while we finish the new ones.

Only while you finish?  Will this option go away when you're satisfied with the new ones?  

<u/spez>: Here's how I see things going: we'll do our very best to get the redesign out. This is a massive effort, involves much of our team, and thousands of user testers (increasing to hundreds of thousands over the next month). The redesign will include another pass at profile pages. We don't have plans to shut off the legacy site, though it may run under a different domain. We'll leave old profile pages there.

Most of the feedback we've received on the new profiles are very addressable, so I'm confident we'll get it to a place most users like, but we'll have the old site just in case.

update: No this wasn't the plan from the beginning, but we also didn't plan on diverting resources to finish up the redesign. We still have a vision for profiles that we believe we be really good for the site, but we're not there yet. We hear your frustration, and will do our best to work out of the situation.
