Title: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

Body: It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions!
