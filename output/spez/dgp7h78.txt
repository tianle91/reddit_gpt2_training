<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators! <u/kcreaky>: What up Steve, hey what kind of music you like to code to? <u/spez>: It's evolved over the years. During my prime programming years, I blasted Metallica and the like, but my tastes are pretty broad. I considered myself extremely fortunate to have a job where I could listen to music all day.

I love dancing. These days I listen to a lot of funk and danceable edm, with a liberal amount of Beatles and Fleetwood Mac mixed in to chill out.
