<r/ModSupport>: 2 important announcements

Hello mods! We’ve expanded our Community Management team, and I have two exciting announcements for you.

First, we’ve hired a new Community Manager to help with the day to day duties, improving community communication, and overall engagement. /u/sodypop, a long time redditor and moderator, packed with tons of institutional knowledge of the site, has joined the reddit team officially!

Why is this being posted in /r/ModSupport, you ask?

Well, the second announcement is that we’ve hired another Community Manager, /u/redtaboo, who will not only be helping with day to day community management duties, communication, and engagement, but will also be replacing me in my brief tenure as **Moderator Advocate**! This means that she'll be your new point of contact for moderator-specific issues. She'll be available to answer questions in here and in other moderator subreddits, and reply to modmail here if you have questions or ideas you don't want to post publicly. Remember, /r/reddit.com modmail and contact@reddit.com are still your go-to channels for general reports!

We’re very excited to have these two on board, so please join us in welcoming them to the team!

<u/kerovon>: I think you forgot to give the name of the second CM you hired.

<u/redtaboo>: It's still a secret. :|
