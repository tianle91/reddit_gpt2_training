Aww, that's so nice of him. <u/SoundsPainfulButFun>: This makes me want to make a cross stitch of his face. But, specifically, an endearingly shitty one. <u/spez>: I actually felt really bad about saying "shitty little things" but I'm happy it was heard with the spirit it was intended. I love the shitty ones.
