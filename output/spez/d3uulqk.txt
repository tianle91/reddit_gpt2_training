<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later.

<u/CMC3BFF>: Ever thought of buying RES and integrating it into the main site so that the vanilla reddit experience is actually worthwhile? 

<u/spez>: Thought of, yes. In reality, probably not. We do appreciate everything they do for us, however. I don't use it myself because I believe I should have to suffer until we make things better.
