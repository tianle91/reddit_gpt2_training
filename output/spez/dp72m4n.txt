<r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

Annnnnnd in other news:

In case you didn’t catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, we’re running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!

This weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1251). Join our team, play games with the Reddit staff, and help us hit our $250k fundraising goal.

Finally, today we’re kicking off our [ninth annual Secret Santa exchange on Reddit Gifts](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/)! This is one of the longest-running traditions on the site, connecting over 100,000 redditors from all around the world through the simple act of giving and receiving gifts. We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, I’m no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I’d love some ideas to keep me busy.

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers! <u/[deleted]>: 1. Please remove r/ice_poseidon from r/all, or maybe reddit altogether. It's a whole sub dedicated to abusing and bullying a streamers girlfriend and this week has taken to spamming porn. It's toxic.

2. You owe the community an explanation as to why the_donald is allowed to continue to operate after another one of reddits famous clean ups.

Thanks.

Edit 2: seeing as this is gaining prominence perhaps.we can talk about r/freshmodels and why reddit is ok with paedophilia?

Edit: by r/all I meant r/popular. However u/spez has chosen to pretend that I edited in my second question for some reason. To clarify; I did not. <u/spez>: We're taking another pass at r/popular, Reddit's default listing, as we speak, and I expect their remove.

r/all will remain unfiltered, but it's opt-in.

edit: you added a second question after I answered. See my [response re the_donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx/). <u/IranianGenius>: Any chance that users will be able to filter more than 100 subreddits?

For users who don't want politics, games they don't play, certain memes, or certain nsfw subs, surely the count is well over 100 now. Not to mention languages we can't speak so we can't really participate in those. There are so many subreddits big enough to hit /r/all now.  <u/spez>: I'm not sure off the top of my head if there is a performance reason or if it's arbitrary. I can follow up, and if it's the latter, it's an easy change.
