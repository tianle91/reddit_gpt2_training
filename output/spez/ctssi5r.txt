<r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.

Which communities have been banned?

<u/spez>: Today we removed communities dedicated to animated CP and a handful of other communities that violate the spirit of the policy by making Reddit worse for everyone else: /r/CoonTown, /r/WatchNiggersDie, /r/bestofcoontown, /r/koontown, /r/CoonTownMods, /r/CoonTownMeta.

<u/Delphizer>: This doesn't look like a comprehensive list, and even if you constantly updated it here, it seems there should be some place that lists what subreddits have been banned and quarantined and what rules they broke. Transparency and all that.

**EDIT 1** : As this picked up steam really fast, my "I totally know what I'm doing and know more than the CEO" off cuff suggestion is to output the database you use for the bans somewhere, this should be an auto updating real time list of bans, it's my understanding from minutes of web coding experience this should be fairly straightforward. :P

Maybe not top priority but I've seen a few call outs for something like that in many comments in many posts and it's largely been ignored. I'm assuming as it's been ignored the agreement is such a place won't exist. A comment one way or another would be appreciated.

<u/spez>: When something gets banned the mods often attempt to recreate the same communities, which we try and stay on top of, so it's an ongoing process today.
