<r/politics>: We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything!

Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  (“CDA 230”) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits.

Sometimes called [“the twenty-six words that created the internet,”](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414)  the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. 
You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden’s efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality).


Proof: https://i.redd.it/jbtpca0xnk131.jpg <u/jews4beer>: We seem to be encroaching (if not already fully entrenched in) the tools of democracy being weaponized in a way that we haven't been up against before. The foundations of freedom on the internet are being levied to mount massive disinformation and influence campaigns. 

Despite all of that, internet freedom is still immensely important albeit extremely fragile. What are some ways we can tackle the spread of disinformation and foreign political interference while still safeguarding the free flow of speech and information. For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions? For Ron Wyden, what can we do legislatively to hold company's that don't act in good faith accountable while still not harming the freedoms of others to be innovative in their business practices? <u/spez>: >For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddit’s greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn’t news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities.
