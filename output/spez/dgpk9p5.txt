<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/KENNNAAAYYY>: Mr. Huffman, thanks for taking the time to talk to everyone on this thing. 

I do like the site and I think that as a collective forum, it's pretty frickin great. I think this  might be something everyone else has asked, but I'll ask anyway. There are plenty of forums out there that operate similarly like Reddit. What did you keep in mind when creating Reddit to truly distinguish yourself from the rest of the competition?

<u/spez>: I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the competition. We try to build what's best for Reddit. Even if we end up copying someone, we know we came to the same conclusion from first principles.
