<r/sanfrancisco>: Reddit Meet-Up Day -- June 9, 2018

It's that time of year again where you get off the internet and into the [foggy] sunshine. 

This year's San Francisco Reddit Meet-up Day will be June 9, in [GGP at the Old Speedway Park](https://goo.gl/maps/DymvoUY8Y9N2). Time is 12-4:30, just like last year. And similar to last year, there will be free swag and free food provided by reddit :) Benefits of being the hometown team! 

See you there! 



<u/harryarchere>: Oh boy! Can't wait to say all the positive things about the Reddit Redesign directly to u/spez's face

<u/spez>: If you’re not being sarcastic, I’m looking forward to it!

But if you are being sarcastic, I’m looking forward to it!
