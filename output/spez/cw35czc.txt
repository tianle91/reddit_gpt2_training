<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! <u/hansjens47>: #1:

/r/redditrequest was added as a stopgap measure 5 years ago.

Currently someone can squat on large and active subreddit communities without any involvement in that subreddit whatsoever, as long as they log into their account once every 2 months.

* **What would it take for the admins to look at new procedures for removing inactive and unresponsive moderators who aren't part of the communities they're supposed to act on behalf of?**

#2:

When the default set of subreddits was changed to encompas 50 subreddits a year or so ago, rather than about 25, the promise was that changes could be made more often to ensure that things stay fresh, and that reddit is an interesting website also for those who don't have accounts.

I think that was at least in part a response to how overdue the un-defaulting of subreddits like /r/politics, /r/adviceanimals and /r/atheism took place. The longer a community is a default and passively builds up users even if mods are failing at running the community, the harder it is to fix those problems afterwards.

* **What would it take to look at the current default subreddits and potential changes to them?**


(corollary: geodefualts don't seem to have received any support in the last year or so either. Are they technically still in beta?)

#3: 

The 2014 US midterm election wasn't covered in the default subreddits. That means that to follow US politics on reddit you have to have an account. A large proportion of redditors don't. 

For a site that takes a stance on political issues like marriage equality and an open and free internet, it seems strange that not all users are exposed to that content, even if it's the regional politics of the location you're in (geodefaults).

* **What would it take to cover the 2016 US presidential election in the defaults in some way?**  <u/spez>: 1. It's something we discuss somewhat regularly around here. We all agree it's a problem. It's not our largest problem at the moment, but we will address it.

2. I don't think the notion of blessing a specific set of communities is sustainable. It requires too much intervention on our side, and it also prevents new communities from breaking into popularity because they hit the "default ceiling". I'm looking forward to tackling this.

3. We don't control the content of the defaults, so it's largely up to them. We do work with them from time to time on more "event"-like situations. For example, if we have connections to a prominent candidate, we can help find them a place on Reddit.
