<r/Showerthoughts>: Reddit is like a friend that you think is really funny at first until you realize that they just repeat the same jokes over and over again.

Edit: Made it to the front page... where's my gold you circle-jerking hypocritical faggots? <u/xrmb>: That problem could be solved by Reddit if your front page would somehow weigh links by redditors that vote like you... maybe it does already and its not working. <u/dis_is_my_account>: That's actually not a horrible idea. /u/spez! Get over here! <u/spez>: Yep. Lots of plans for the front page.
