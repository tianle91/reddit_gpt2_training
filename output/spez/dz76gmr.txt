<r/TheoryOfReddit>: Why did they change the reddit to new reddit?

[removed] <u/spez>: You can use the old layout indefinitely. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and uncheck "use the redesign as my default experience." I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. 

As for why:

1. New tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. [Here's our most recent update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8jgu1q/51518_release_notes_inbox_count_post_flair/)
2. Easier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 2â€“5x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.
3. Adapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100&#37; outbound links and self\-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.
4. Ads. In\-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in\-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.
5. Perception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with "old and difficult to use" isn't good for business.
6. Portable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.

We've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant "feedback" is highly motivating to the team.

Personally, I've switched my desktop Reddit\-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy. I'd encourage folks to give it a try. If you don't like it, opt\-out and hopefully check back in in a month. It's updating rapidly.
