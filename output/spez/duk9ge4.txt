<r/mildlyinfuriating>: The 4th and 5th oldest reddit users.

<u/BoyceKRP>: I am more irritated that Matrix7531 was the 9th user to make an account, with no competition for an original name at all, and still litters it with a spiel of random numbers.

<u/spez>: Matrix is my cousin. That’s the name he used to use all over.

pg is Paul Graham, our first investor. Bugbear and connman were buddies. 

I don’t remember who meegan was. 

Update: matrix forgot his password. I’ll fix when I get home, and he can explain for himself...
