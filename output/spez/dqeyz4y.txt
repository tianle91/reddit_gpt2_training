<r/blog>: An update on the fight for the free and open internet

**Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!

Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what’s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You’ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday’s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCC’s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality’s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don’t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don’t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC’s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel’s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to “make a ruckus” to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we’re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to — if it comes to it — the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

u/ArabScarab \(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\), and I will hang around to answer questions. <u/Jakeable>: What's the expected monetary cost to reddit if a policy like this is put into place? <u/spez>: It's hard to say exactly, and that's part of the problem.

Most Americans have little or no choice of ISPs, and as it happens, the largest ISPs in the US are also some of the largest media companies.

For consumers, this means the ISP you are practically forced to use also can control what media you have access to.

For business, this means you are at the mercy of the ISPs, who as media companies are also likely competitors, to reach your customer. Bandwidth intensive, yet worldly important companies like Netflix and YouTube would have a really hard time getting off the ground if they existed at the whims of the major ISPs/media companies.
