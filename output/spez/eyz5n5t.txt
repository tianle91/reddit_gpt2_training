<r/BurningMan>: To the person who left 2 used tampons and a puddle of shit in our camp

My campmate was nice enough to pack your stuff out for you. Post your address and we'll make sure it gets back to you.

<u/GambishChildino1>: Maybe it was an inside job. As in someone from your camp. Perhaps the person you least expect.

<u/gorleg>: I bet it was Steve

<u/CoeFam>: Its always Steve

<u/spez>: :(
