<r/technology>: Reddit is now censoring posts and communities on a country-by-country basis <u/TheChickening>: Reddit is not the freedom fighter you want it to be. It's a company that wants to earn money. <u/spez>: Of course we want to earn money–that's how businesses continue to exist–but that didn't factor into our decision here.

The issue in this case is we faced the dilemma of either banning content in specific regions or having Reddit blocked entirely in these regions. Unfortunately, there isn't a middle ground in this case.

While we believe government censorship of the Internet is wrong (not to mention futile), we also need to make practical decisions to ensure Reddit is accessible to as many people as possible around the entire world.
