<r/AskReddit>: Doomsday preppers, whatâ€™s something everyone should have in their bunker? <u/triple__jeopardy>: Ask u/spez. I'm sure he has some plans.

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich <u/spez>: The funny thing is I'm not actually a prepper. It's true, I do own a couple guns, have had eye surgery, and am into motorcycles, and it's true those things would come in handy if society collapsed, but really what happened with that article is I thought I was talking on background about people I know who are actually preppers and gave a bunch of colorful (and cringey) quotes, which is an unfortunate habit I have.

In reality, the only thing I'm qualified to shoot are empty Bud Light cans; I wanted to be able to see the toilet at night when I pee; and, motorcycles are cool.
