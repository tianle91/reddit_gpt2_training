<r/IAmA>: I am Andrew Marantz, a writer at The New Yorker.

I've written about media, tech, politics, and other topics. I recently wrote a piece about Reddit (see below). Ask me anything!

Edit: Thanks for the questions, guys. I'm off to write the next piece! <u/dangerbook>: Have you had any major trollish backlash to your New Yorker article? <u/A_Marantz>: Not really. In fact I'm a little surprised that no one is trolling me right now. Low energy. <u/spez>: Allow me to assist... the trolls should be here any minute. 

(And, Hi! It was a pleasure getting to know you and your team. Iâ€™m still working up the courage the read the piece myself.) <u/Colin151>: Hey spezbag! Gonna ban /r/the_donald yet? You know, after letting russia interfere with the election and spread misinformation, i'm wondering why you think its alright for this to occur while the subreddit also radicalizes people to violence.

Just curious. I know you won't answer.

Ban /r/the_donald . Do it. <u/spez>: There it is.
