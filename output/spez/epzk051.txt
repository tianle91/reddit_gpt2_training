<r/politics>: We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything!

Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  (“CDA 230”) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits.

Sometimes called [“the twenty-six words that created the internet,”](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414)  the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. 
You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden’s efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality).

<u/SouthernJeb>: Hello  /u/senatorwyden, I have a two part question:

1) Do You support Mr. Huffman's decision to allow subreddits such as The_Donald to continue to have a presence on the site, despite continuous sharing and posting of questionable and subversive content? Why/Why not?

2) As Reddit has grown into a huge website for discourse, do you feel that sites such as this are obligated to remove nefarious/questionable accounts (i.e. foreign-state sponsored) along with questionable content? Why/Why not?

<u/senatorwyden>: Mr Huffman has the First Amendment right to support whatever content he chooses to, as does any private business. And other users have the right to choose whether or not they want to associate with a site that hosts that kind of content. 

From what I am told, The_Donald is home to messages that cross the line toward inciting the hatred that is eroding our democracy and it would be good to see Mr. Huffman and Reddit to do more work to moderate such behavior. 

on #2 - While they're not legally obligated to do anything, any American site should remove any foreign state-sponsored content, whether it is Russian bots, or Chinese deniers of the Tiananmen massacre.

<u/spez>: Thank you, Senator.

As it relates to r/the_donald specifically, we watch them closely, and we do our best to hold them to the same standards and policies as we do all communities. Before we action any community, we also speak to moderators regarding rule breaking behaviors. To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldn’t hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.

Yes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.

I wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the community—certainly it would make some things easier—but the reality is that banning a large political community that isn’t in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.

I know this isn’t the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach.
