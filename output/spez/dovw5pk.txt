<r/modnews>: Update on site-wide rules regarding violent content

Hello All--

We want to let you know that we have made some updates to our site-wide rules regarding violent content. We did this to alleviate user and moderator confusion about allowable content on the site. We also are making this update so that Reddit’s content policy better reflects our values as a company. 

In particular, we found that the policy regarding “inciting” violence was too vague, and so we have made an effort to adjust it to be more clear and comprehensive. Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. This applies to ALL content on Reddit, including memes, CSS/community styling, flair, subreddit names, and usernames. 

We understand that enforcing this policy may often require subjective judgment, so all of the usual caveats apply with regard to content that is newsworthy, artistic, educational, satirical, etc, as mentioned in the policy. Context is key. The policy is posted in the help [center here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-violent-content). 

**EDIT**: Signing off, thank you to everyone who asked questions! Please feel free to send [us any other questions](https://www.reddit.com/contact/). As a reminder, Steve is doing an AMA in r/announcements next week. 
 <u/Deimorz>: Why is this posted in /r/modnews and not /r/announcements? All users should be informed about site-wide rules changes, not only moderators. <u/landoflobsters>: As this is a clarification/update of an existing rule, we wanted to post here first. However, Steve will be doing an AMA next week in r/announcements and this update will be covered.  <u/[deleted]>: Does /u/spez want to save us all some time and just x-post the announcement to /r/subredditdrama when he posts it? <u/spez>: mod me pls
