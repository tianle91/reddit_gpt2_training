<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. <u/[deleted]>: Anything new you can tell us about privacy on reddit? <u/spez>: Not a lot new, but I can repeat how we feel: privacy colors many of our conversations around here. We have a good [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3tlcil/we_are_updating_our_privacy_policy_effective_jan); we released a thorough [transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015), which will be even more thorough next year because we're keeping better records; and that whole techno-libertarian, super-paranoid viewpoint that exists on Reddit? That came from me, and has been upheld by many others around here over the years.

edit: I have a hard time with links.
