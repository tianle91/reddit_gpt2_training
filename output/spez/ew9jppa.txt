Title: Is there a place for coding questions where it starts really basic and the problems progress and build off each other?

Body: Basically the title. I know a lot of problems have similar solutions or principles. I'm just curious if there is a place I can go that will progressively help me learn almost like a study plan. Some times I feel like I try a problem and there is just too much context missing.

Q: What do you think?
A: I used to turn to the [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) when learning a new language. If you can do them all, I'm sure you'll find a full-time gig programming Prolog in no time.
