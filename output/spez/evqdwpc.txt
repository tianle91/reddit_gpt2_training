Title: I feel like I don’t have any “real friends” and it’s bothering me

Body: I’m not sure if I’ve just been a dumbass in my whole 19 years of living but this past week I’ve taken a step back from my friendships to examine them and honestly most of them don’t feel “genuine”, if that makes sense. In particular, this one group of friends I’ve been around since high school. They will from time to time invite me over to hang out with them or when they have a party they’ll tell me to get over there, but when I’m actually there it feels a bit disingenuous. Just little interactions, if another guest at their house gives me a hug cuz we haven’t seen each other since graduation a couple of them will follow suit. which feels extremely forced considering they don’t normally do that and I see them way more often than the guest in particular. That coupled with the fact that it doesn’t rlly feel like anybody wants to make plans with me on the off chance I ask because I assume they are my friends. It also seems like the friends I made in college are the same way, where they originally sounded like they wanted to meet up this summer, whenever I actually talk serious about it nobody wants to say when they’re free. It just makes me feel like perhaps I’m just somebody nobody really wants to be around.

Q: What do you think?
A: I think I read this on r/wholesomememes a while ago, but it's stuck with me: *The secret to having good friends is to be a good friend.* You can't control their feelings and actions towards you, but you can control your feelings and actions towards them. If you make the effort, give them a call, plan things, invite them, I suspect you'll find what you're looking for, whether clarity or friendship.
