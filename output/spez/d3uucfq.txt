<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. <u/ConfusedHerring>: What's the best and worst thing about running Reddit? <u/spez>: The best part is being a part of something so important to so many people. It's a lot of fun most of the time, and even when it's not fun, it's very exciting and challenging. It's not always easy to find that in a job, and I'm really fortunate to have it in mine.

The hardest part is watching what I say publicly. Everything is recorded and judged. Our PR team is always lecturing me to be a little less Joe Biden.
