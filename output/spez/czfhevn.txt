<r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out https://www.reddit.com/jobs. <u/[deleted]>: [deleted] <u/spez>: Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. That's why we released the [better banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tools a couple months ago, which allows us to put a user in timeout with an explanation. This helps correct behavior.

Moderators can still ban users from their communities, and it's not transparent. I don't like this, and I get a lot of complaints from confused users. However, the moderators don't have a ton of alternatives. [Improving reporting with more rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/42o2i0/moderators_subreddit_rules_now_available_for_all/) is a step in the right direction. It's my desire that moderators will rely on banning less and less as we build better tooling. <u/glr123>: Hi /u/Spez, can you comment on the criticism that Suspensions/Muting and the new tools have actually caused an increase in the animosity between users and moderators? In /r/science, this is a constant problem that we deal with. 

Muting users has done essentially the same thing as banning them has - it ultimately tells them their behavior is unacceptable, and encourages them to reach out in modmail to discuss the situation with us further. 90% of the time, this results in them sending hateful messages to use that are full of abuse. We are then told to mute them in modmail, and they are back in 72 hours to abuse us some more. We have gone to the community team to report these users, and are told completely mixed answers. In some cases, we are told that by merely messaging the user to stop abusing us in modmail, we are engaging them and thus nothing can be done. In other cases, we are told that since we didn't tell them to stop messaging us, nothing can be done.

You say that you want to improve moderator relations, but these new policies have only resulted in us fielding *more* abuse. It has gotten so bad in /r/science, that we have resorted to just banning users with automod and not having the automated reddit system send them any more messages, as the level of venomous comments in modmail has gotten too high to deal with. We have even recently had moderators receive death threats over such activities. This is the exact opposite scenario that you would wish to happen, but the policies on moderator abuse are so lax that we have had to take actions into our own hands.

How do you plan to fix this? <u/spez>: Ok, thanks for the feedback. We can do better. I will investigate.
