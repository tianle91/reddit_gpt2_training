<r/pics>: These two young men presenting their project in hopes of getting funded. Now they are founders of the 6th most visited site in the World! Happy 13th anniversary Reddit. <u/spez>: Our accounts are 13 years old today, but I believe Reddit itself didn't launch for another two weeks or so. Thank you nevertheless! <u/RockAndHODL>: Can you please ban r/funny ? They aren't as funny as they think they are! <u/spez>: We investigate this community often but have not found it to be in violation of our content policy. We will reach out to the mods as needed about enforcing their own rules (specifically Rule 0: All posts must make an attempt at humor).
