Title: Has r/popular caused the loss of actually discussion on Reddit for new users (and by extension, all of Reddit over time)?

Body: Edit - sorry about the typo, phone keyboard. Please don't spam r/titlegore in the comments

Back when the site had a list of curated defaults, new users were exposed to a variety of quality topics and communities that delivered a great deal of quality discussion 

Now with r/popular the user experience is almost entirely driven by comedy and memes since this content gets a quick reaction from the most users and thus the highest ranking on the site. Content with more substance doesn't reach users who aren't already subscribed to these subreddits.

I don't have a good example off the top of my head but when a non comedy oriented sub his the front page, it's almost always just because somebody posted a meta meme that gets the most laughs.

Is Reddit going to continue to let this happen? You can say that users have the option to go find subs to subscribe to, but I really think this is a loss of the quality discussion Reddit was once known for.

Q: What do you think?
A: You might be right. We noticed this too and have been looking into it. We will have more to share soon.

A: Dang I was just writing a reply to this as well. Guess we got the same push notif.
