<r/ipad>: What happened to alien blue?

Interacting with comments is next to impossible. Links won't let me click them. Pictures do some weird thing where they intersect numerous comments. I just hit reply on a comment and all it did was make the comment below it with a link change to have a duplicate. Bacon Reader is a joke on iOS. AMRC is alright, but ugly and limited. Why did reddit buy alien blue and let it go to shit immediately? 

<u/a_calder>: While it isn't perfect, I enjoy using AB a lot more than any of the other clients out there.  AMRC gets mentioned a lot, but I used it for a couple weeks and my eyes couldn't take the pain any more.

The new CEO /u/spez has mentioned a few times that he thinks mobile is very important and reddit needs to do a better job. I'm not clear as to whether that is just the web/responsive version or whether he wants /u/jase to get the support he needs to make AB good again.

<u/spez>: Both, in fact.
