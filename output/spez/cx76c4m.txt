<r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

In a little over a month we’ll be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it’s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. I’ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

edit: Thanks for all the feedback. I'm off for now.

<u/eberkneezer>: A quick glance

**New policy**

> How We Use Information About You :    **Personalize the Services and provide advertisements**, content and features that match user profiles or interests.


> We will not share, sell, or give away any of our users’ personal information to third parties, unless one of the following circumstances applies:  Except as it relates to advertisers and our ad partners, **we may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers** who need access to such information to carry out work for us


**Old policy**

> While advertisers may target their ads to the topic of a given subreddit or based on your IP address, we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information collected about our users to any third party.

So it looks like you are going to be profiling users in order to advertise to them.  The old system had advertising based on the profile of the subreddit and not the users.  It also looks like you are sharing/selling  information with your advertisers.

Sounds like the changes to the privacy policy is to allow the creepy annoying advertising.  The type that makes adblocking popular.

<u/spez>: We're still not selling or giving access to individual user data. That is important to us, and we state in the privacy we won't do this. ("This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers.")

We would like to allow advertisers to target on more than just communities, however. For example, targeting based on keywords will be helpful–there is a lot gaming content on Reddit outside of communities dedicate specifically to gaming.
