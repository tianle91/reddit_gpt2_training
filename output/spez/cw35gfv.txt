<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! <u/Revesilia>: Anything you could foreshadow as to what community tools we might expect? <u/spez>: Other than the thousand general product improvements we'd like to make, the big problems on our mind are community discovery (it's hard for redditors to find new communities, let alone new users), and community growth (how do you attract new users to your up-and-coming community. Two sides of the same coin, but both supremely important in my mind.
