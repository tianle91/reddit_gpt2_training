<r/announcements>: Marty Weiner, Reddit CTO, back to CTO all the things

Aaaarr-arahahhraarrrr.  That’s Wookie for “Hello again, hope you’re doing well, AMAE (ask me anything engineering), aaarrhhuu-uhh”,

I’m back to chat [as promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3hs3v4/im_marty_weiner_the_new_reddit_cto/).  It’s already been a month and a wild ride the whole time.  I’ve really gotten to know this amazing team and where we need to head (apparently there’s lots to do here… who knew?).

Here’s a few updates:

* I’m still [surprisingly photogenic](http://imgur.com/G7G9BRK)
* R2’s legs [have made progress](http://i.imgur.com/zz0OeFz.jpg) (glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he’d agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely "super highest priority".

Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.

I have about 1.17 hours now to answer questions, and then I'm going and playing with my wee ones.

Edit: Running to my train.  If I can get a seat, I'll finish off some in-flight answers.  XOXOXO, Marty

<u/spez>: The big feature we lack right now is keyword targeting, and perhaps more importantly, anti-keyword targeting. Right now, advertisers have very little control over who actually sees their ads because they can only target at the community level, and they're very concerned about brand safety. Basically, they want to say, I want my ad to show around conversations about *this* topic, but not *that* topic.

As far as tracking, we will continue to serve ads in an iframe, which dramatically limits what information an advertiser sees (e.g. they don't see what urls you're on), and we will provide ways to opt-out (more than we offer now).

Philosophically, I'm as paranoid as anyone about advertisers knowing what I'm up to online–it's a common characteristic of most Reddit employees, in fact–so that guides our thinking.

<u/verdatum>: /u/spez, I've genuinely been impressed of the changes that I've seen since you took over.  (and I will happily go on record that I never bore ill will towards Ellen Pao; she did fine by me) but much of the excellent input from yourself, and from the other admins have frequently fallen under the upvote radar.

I'm very glad that I have the ability to lookup admins by username and read through recent comments.  Doing this, I have often learned pieces of the story that I would have otherwise missed out upon.

Part of me wishes this wasn't the case; that I didn't have to go through the list of big players on Reddit to learn what has been going on; what "official" statements have been made. But at the same time, I don't know if I have any suggestions on how to improve this concern.

As often is the case with these burgeoning online communities, the more time that passes, the more difficult it can become to outsiders to understand and become aware of the political details involved.  This can risk closing off the community, which is contrary to the ideals of social networking.

I hate to be one to just point out problems without offering solutions; but I don't know if I have terribly good solutions.  I don't know if I'm such a major demographic, but I suppose I would like to see a centralized place, that regularly tracks the activity of these sort of accounts, and gives an account of what details have been revealed. And then have that place well advertised to users, while at the same time not coming off as spammy and propaganda; just a neutral accounting of what's new.  This wouldn't be easy, but I, for one at least, feel such a thing would be useful to get out a clear narrative.

Thanks for doing what you do. Similar to PotUSA, I wouldn't take on such a task for the world.

<u/spez>: Thanks for the kind words. Your suggestion is something to think about. Honestly, it would be helpful for me as well. A lot has changed over the years...
