<r/CasualConversation>: Six weeks ago I had my eyes lasered, and it's been among the best decisions of my life

<u/spez>: I'm so happy for you. I feel the same way after getting my eyes fixed almost three years ago. There are so many small day-to-day life improvements I've gotten to experience as a result. For example, falling asleep watching tv with my contacts in used to be a major mistake as I'd later have to pry stale contacts off my eyeballs while half asleep. Now, it's just falling asleep.
