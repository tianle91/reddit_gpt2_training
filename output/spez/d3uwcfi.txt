Title: AMA about my darkest secrets

Body: Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later.

Q: What do you think?
A: 1. What do you think makes reddit different to other social media sites out there? 2. Batman vs 100 badgers, who wins?

A: 1. People can be their authentic selves in a way they can't anywhere else. They can also be someone else's authentic self. 2. Batman. He's the world's greatest detective.
