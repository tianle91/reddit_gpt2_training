<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. <u/ReallyAmused>: why do you have all our secrets? - what did you mean by that statement?  <u/spez>: The sentiment I was trying to convey is that people share many different facets of their personalities on Reddit, which doesn't happen many other places online or even in real life sometimes. 

As it happens, the quote you're referring to was tongue-in-cheek and needlessly douchey. My bad.
