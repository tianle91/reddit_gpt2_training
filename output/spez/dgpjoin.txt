<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/[deleted]>: Hi Steve,
Not quite career related but while I have the chance to ask you, what is so bad about the Boston area that every startup, including Reddit, that started here runs away to the west coast as soon as they "make it"? What were your reasons?

<u/spez>: We left because we got acquired.

My friends moved here because the startup ecosystem is more mature. If you're starting a company, it's easier to raise money here. If you're looking for work, there are more opportunities. The gap is closing, but the Bay is still the best.

The weather doesn't hurt either.
