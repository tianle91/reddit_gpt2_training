<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/Rennir>: Hi Spez,

I'm a new grad that's been working for a specific company for 6 months so far, and I'm not really liking my job and want to move to a different company. Do you have any advice to someone with 6-12 months of industry experience applying for a job again? Perhaps also how you would view such an application? Would I essentially be considered a new grad for recruiting purposes or be held to a higher standard?

<u/spez>: First, gut-check what you don't like about the company. Make sure it's not something about yourself that you can fix. Otherwise, you'll get a new job and feel the same way in 6 months.

Just a few months at a company raises some questions. We'll be asking why it's so short, and trying to determine whether it's you or the company. 

We'd suss out your level during the recruiting process.
