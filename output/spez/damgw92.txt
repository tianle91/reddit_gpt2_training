In subreddit: announcements

Title: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

Body: **tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

Steve

PS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&fm=mp4&mp4-fragmented=false&s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I’m old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.


Q: What do you think?
A: * Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know? * Has this ever happened before? * Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit? edit: (from me, not /u/spez. Really) I'm glad you saw it to apologize. I was in the "so fucking what"/"it was just a small edit" camp but I can see why some people would be so angry about it. It was poor judgement and you put yourself in a lose-lose situation. That said, most of us will still use the site as before because I honestly can't think of any other content aggregator like this one. I'm also glad you guys finally got around to implementing the sub-reddit blocking feature. I'd done that with RES a long time and I truly didn't understand why people were so bent out of shape over /r/the_donald. If the charges about "doxxing, harassment" etc. are true (and I can see it happening) then the questions to ask are * is the sub responsible for it? If yes, then what do reddit's policies say about this behavior? * if the sub isn't responsible then how are you * evaluating the truth in this accusation * taking action to protect reddit from other websites and social media * planning to prevent something like this (power user getting harassed to the point of doing something extremely silly/unprofessional) from every happening again?

A: > Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know? No. Only engineers with access to production data, and that is being limited. > Has this ever happened before? In 2009 I replaced the word "fag" with "fog". Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default. This whole experience has been pretty painful. Even with the best of intentions, I (we) won't do this again. > Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit? The clear cut policies are in our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

A: >Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default. Question for you. I understand the reason for not editing titles is to not have people create popular posts and then change the title to something inflammatory. However, why not allow a small 5 minute window to change the title? It shouldn't be long enough to blow up but may be long enough to help prevent a typo

A: > However, why not allow a small 5 minute window to change the title? It shouldn't be long enough to blow up but may be long enough to help prevent a typo Totally reasonable.
