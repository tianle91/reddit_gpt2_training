Title: I hear the feedback on CSS / styles. I’m traveling, but will be back next week to chat more.

Body: Hey All,

I just wanted to leave a quick note and say we’re listening to all the feedback around CSS / customization. The quietness on my end is because I’m traveling and won’t have a couple hours to chat until next week, and I want to make sure I have time to answer questions. I appreciate all the feedback so far (and the fact that it’s been overwhelmingly polite!).

Cheers,

Steve
