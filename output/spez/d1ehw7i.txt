<r/ModSupport>: 1+ Month with no admin response on ban evaders

I mod a few trading subs and we have significant issues with ban evaders and malicious impersonators. Initially the admins were very responsive. I provide a list of known ban evaders and impersonators and I usually got feedback within 24 hours or a couple of days at the most. It began to taper off a couple of months ago with response times getting slower and slower until finally nothing. I've bumped the last reply I got from them with new information and requests to reply but have gotten nothing for over a month. 

I'd like to know if they're not responding to ban evasion anymore or if there's some sort of policy change that they just haven't disclosed. A month with no response though is frustrating and I'd like to know what's going on. 

<u/spez>: PM me the info, and I'll take a look.

edit: looks like we got to it a couple of days ago before I saw this.
