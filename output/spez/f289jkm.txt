<r/cscareerquestions>: Iâ€™m starting to believe everything I learned in relation to coding/software is inherently useless and it affecting my life

<u/spez>: Coding is a really valuable skill.

Have you considered volunteering and teaching it to others? I've personally found fulfillment in helping others learn to code. It's fun and free.

Incidentally, one of the people who helped me learn to program was doing so because he head a disease that was going to render him braindead in ten years, so he decided to give back by teaching others.
