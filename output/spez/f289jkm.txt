<r/cscareerquestions>: I’m starting to believe everything I learned in relation to coding/software is inherently useless and it affecting my life

I had an epiphany the other day of how I was currently living through my career after getting diagnosed with an incurable deteriorating illness.

I can’t shake the feeling that everything I learned for software engineering is just useless. I understand it is my skill that helps me pay the bill but that’s all it’s become for me. Learning about design patterns, advanced techniques, languages, it’s unfulfilling because while these are practical skills for work, they entirely useless in any other aspect of my life. I spend my days brainstorming how I’m going to refactor some webpage from Angular to React because my boss said so because “everyone’s on React now”. My coworkers argue and actually get angry about how the refactoring process should happen.

I just feel like I led a very meaningless and useless career that was mainly for the reason to kill time and have a living. It’s nice I have money but it’s all I got. I was always a money chaser who wanted to FIRE thinking I could start after I retired but now all my savings are drained due to my illness. I just can’t stand another day at work thinking that everything I’m doing there does literally nothing for society or even myself, besides the fact that I have money.

As much as money solves a lot of issues, it’s not solving my happiness. Maybe I can shell out more to see a third psychiatrist who says my mood is due to my illness and won’t help me at all.

<u/spez>: Coding is a really valuable skill.

Have you considered volunteering and teaching it to others? I've personally found fulfillment in helping others learn to code. It's fun and free.

Incidentally, one of the people who helped me learn to program was doing so because he head a disease that was going to render him braindead in ten years, so he decided to give back by teaching others.
