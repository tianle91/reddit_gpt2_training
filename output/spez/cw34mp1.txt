<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions!

<u/PikachuSnowman>: What happened to the promise that some of reddit's profits were going to be distributed back to the members in some way?

<u/spez>: We're still maintaining that stock for this purpose. The challenge is the mechanism through which we distribute it, and when. There are many legal and tax implications that need to be worked through. I'm sad to say we haven't spent a ton of time on it since I've returned other than to reaffirm, that yes, we are going to do it.

Because I don't anticipate a liquidity event for a while (nor are we profitable), we don't have anything to distribute, so we're not in a huge rush.
