<r/announcements>: Let’s all have a town hall about r/all

Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

u: I'm off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I'll check back in a couple hours. <u/karmanaut>: Hey Spez,

I'd like to propose an *alternative* to /r/All, which would be something like /r/Outstanding.

Sorting by most upvotes is great. But what I would *really* want to see are those posts that really *exceed* the expectations of their respective subreddits. Let's say that /r/Pics regularly has posts that get to 5,000 points. Obviously those will show up in /r/All, even if they're nothing special. It's just because /r/Pics is so big, and the top post is bound to get that high.

But, at the same time, let's say that the /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds subreddit (not sure if that's a real thing) normally gets only 50 votes per post, but a post today got *100* votes. Whoa! *Double* what they regularly get. That must mean that it's a really good submission, right? That's the kind of content I want to see. 

The overall basis of it should be votes by percentage of subscribers, or something along those lines. it needs to take in the population of the subreddit into account. Obviously there would need to be some control (like if a submission in /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds was linked to in a popular /r/Askreddit post) to prevent brigading style stuff. But that can all be tweaked; just think about the concept.

--------

Pros of this system (as opposed to /r/All)

* Will allow for better subreddit discovery because small subreddits will be able to get on the list more easily.

* Takes away the advantage of massive default subreddits.

* Can't be dominated by one subreddit regularly, unless it continually exceeds its previous records (which would be really difficult). 

* Would really highlight the very best of Reddit or the most important news.  <u/spez>: So, that's approximately how the current front page works. We normalize the scores and sort by the most outstanding. It's limited to defaults / subscriptions, though.

You basically describe the new frontpage algorithm I've been fantasizing about. We started work on this, in fact, but we re-allocated that brainpower (u/KeyserSosa) to focus on anti-evil for a while. We have since hired more brainpower and have less evil, so I'm hopeful we can get back to it soon. <u/reboticon>: Can you expand on what you mean by 'having less evil?'

I like this /r/all change and I like that you made an announcement about it. <u/spez>: > Can you expand on what you mean by 'having less evil?'

We've made a lot of progress fighting spam, Account Take Overs (ATOs), and reported abuse over the past few months.
