<r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I’d share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Hi All,

We’ve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We’re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We’re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I’ll be here a couple hours.

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more. <u/yashendra2797>: I'm sorry, but I (like many) are firmly against the geo-specific version of Reddit. Many of us fell in love with Reddit primarily because it was global. It didn't matter if you were in India (like me), or France, or Korea, you saw what was going on in the world. The problem that many of us predict is that we will see Reddit become just another Facebook, with all new users succumbing to the ecosystem.

The key ideal of Reddit is that it helped expand the minds of many who came here. We all changed our opinions as we interacted with people throughout the globe, and expanded our horizons into things we normally would. 

I'll be honest /u/spez. Many of us core users are afraid that new features like removing CSS, Reddit profiles, and geo specific frontpages will keep users firmly limited to their own ideas and thought processes, and change the uniqueness of each community. I was ambivalent to the first 2 changes, but this is one where I'm legitimately concerned.

Also, there's the problem of new users being turned off by the echo chamber. I for example, rarely visit /r/india, despite being an Indian living in India. Will I be forced to see political posts and the general flustercuck of my region? Because if that happens, I'd rather just switch to Facebook.

Key thing is IMO you are limiting the kind of Redditors that made Reddit great in the first place, and instead inviting more and more  of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp. <u/spez>: > instead inviting more and more of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp

Stop. Reddit is 300M+ people. It's a big place, and according to users, it has been in steady decline for over a decade now.

The reality is not everyone is interested in an English-only, US-centric view of the world.

The work we are doing is purely additive. Don't like geo-popular? Don't use it. Don't like profile pages? Don't use it. Want to hang out on r/all all day? Cool. It's not going anywhere.
