<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/[deleted]>: Hello!

Thank you for doing this AMA! Do you have any advice for someone who is looking to accomplish what you've accomplished? I very badly want to create something with my own hands that other people use. Part of it is so that I can work on something I'm passionate about every day, but a lot of it is because I want to see people use what I've created. As a musician, I've had other people listen to my music and comment on it and it's just great. I would love to have other people use my software too! 

I have the technical know-how, I've been developing for about 6 years now. And I have some ideas that could potentially turn into something. I would just like to hear what you went through when you first started Reddit, how you came up with the idea, executed it, and any pitfalls that you could help newbies avoid!

Thanks :)

Stick with this. I often say I'd be happy installing garage door openers for people. It's fun when other people appreciate your work. We're fortunate that at Reddit we can do it on a worldwide scale, but the feeling is the same.
