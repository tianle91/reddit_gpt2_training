<r/lifehacks>: Useful folding technique

<u/spez>: Fun fact: this was one of [the first posts ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/2439/flash_how_to_fold_a_shirt/). I think this is the original, but maybe I found one of the first reposts ever. I recall this being the first and only Reddit link I showed my grandma.

I've been folding shirts this way for over 10 years as a result.

<u/alien122>: quick question, so [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/87) is the first post, supposedly. Why does the id start at 87?

what happened to 1-86?

<u/spez>: When we deployed the site to production the first time, I submitted http://yahoo.com over and over to test it. Back then I used to develop against the production machines as well :-/
