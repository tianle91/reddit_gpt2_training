<r/AlienBlue>: A New Chapter: Reddit for iOS

Hey everyone! I'm the product manager for our mobile apps here at Reddit. 

We wanted to give you an update on the state of Reddit for iOS, which some of you may have heard about in u/spez’s [most recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/). What started last year as a plan to update Alien Blue to make it bigger and better - grew into a much bigger project. We now have a beautiful, functional new app for iOS that we’re confident will be the best way to access Reddit content on your phone. 


That said, we know Alien Blue is loved by many as it is. And because this new app will be so different from what you now know as Alien Blue, we’ve decided to make the new version into its own app (and sku) called Reddit. 


Alien Blue will continue to be available to its current users, but we’ll be moving the team over to focus our energy on the new flagship app. As such, Alien Blue will be unavailable for download by new users once the new app is released.


The whole team here has been hard at work on this and we’re looking forward to sharing it with you. We’re beginning a closed beta test for the app in the next couple of weeks. As we did with Reddit for Android, we’re opening up sign-ups [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/46ge0j/sign_up_for_the_reddit_for_ios_mobile_beta/) so you can get early access and provide us with feedback before the app is open to the public. 


Thanks again for all your support. We know our Alien Blue users are some of our most passionate redditors, and we look forward to showing you what we’ve got and working with you to make it even better. As a starting point, please comment below your favorite features of Alien Blue you’d like to see in the new app, and I’ll work with the team to scope and prioritize them.


I’ll be hanging out here in the comments to answer questions! 


<u/spez>: I can't overstate how excited I am about this. I've been an Alien Blue user for many years–it's where I do 90% of my redditting–and u/jase (the author) is a genius. That said, the new app is looking dope. The new iOS team is FLYING. I can't wait for it to be in the hands of users (including me).
