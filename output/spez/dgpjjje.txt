<r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators! <u/[deleted]>: [deleted] <u/spez>: We do ask questions like these. It's usually framed as, how would you build a service that does X? And then we ask follow up questions until one of us is stumped. It's actually a fairly fun line of questioning because we'll see new ideas from time to time.

Most of my interviewing these days is either the first or last conversation with people, and it's less me interviewing and more me pitching Reddit.
