<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. <u/ProfoundlyProfound>: Why are power mods still allowed, you know the ones, they lord over 100-300 subs squatting and waiting for them to become relevant...and then they promptly treat redditors like garbage?

Visit /r/MakingAMurderer sometime, one just absolutely destroyed it.  They all had to flee to another sub /r/TickTockManitowoc. (Another example reached the [front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/4m8kii/the_inmates_are_truly_running_the_asylum/) yesterday.)

This is an all too common practice and I don't understand why this type of behavior is allowed? Why are we allowing power mods to exist? 

Edit: Hey Spez, [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4megfw/ama_about_my_darkest_secrets/d3uw68h), one of the very I guys I was talking about turned up. Here's your chance to see for yourself and give us some sort of answer on the issue. <u/spez>: This is a tricky one. The problems we see are a result of a couple of decisions we made a long time ago, not understanding their longterm consequences: simplistic moderator hierarchy and valuable real-estate in r/ urls. Unwinding these decisions requires a lot of thought and finesse. Reddit wouldn't exist as it does today without the good moderators, and we need to be very careful to continue to empower them while filtering out the bad actors. I'd like to be more specific–our thinking is more specific–but we're not ready to share anything just yet.
