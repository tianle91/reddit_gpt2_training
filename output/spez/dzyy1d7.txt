<r/redesign>: Links in a post no longer look anything like links, and probably should

There is no style around the link that this user posted. Meaning, old school websites would have the text blue and underlined. For what it is worth, that style is preserved when I go to the page with all of my comments, but not within the subreddit itself. Is this a subreddit specific style, or a global setting? \(Either way, I hope it can be rethought. I read the dude's comment with a fine toothed comb, making sure my tired eyes were not missing a link. The only thing I did \*not\* do was literally mouse over those two words...\)

<u/spez>: I was just about the tell the team about this one as well. Underlining markdown links would be nice. For some themes, the color choices make links in comments and posts basically invisible.
