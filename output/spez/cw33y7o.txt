<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions!

<u/LintGrazOr8>: I just want to ask. Is there any specific direction you guys want reddit to head towards? I see things like the Upvoted but I'm not entirely sure how it's supposed to be useful for me as a redditor. I guess I'm just asking what your plans are. Thanks!

<u/spez>: Right, Upvoted is really aimed at non-redditors. The goal is to show more people all the cool stuff that happens on Reddit every day, and hopefully bring more people into our communities.

Our short term plans I've talked about a lot: release proper mobile apps, mod/community tools, stabilize infrastructure, hire, hire hire.

Long term, we believe every person in the world should be able to enjoy Reddit. To do this, we need to improve the product in just about every dimension.
