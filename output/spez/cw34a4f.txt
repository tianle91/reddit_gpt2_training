<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! <u/[deleted]>: Anything to say about the servers, more specifically about improving them? 

Errors are way too often. <u/spez>: One of our major priorities this quarter is to stabilize the infrastructure. We're making progress, but we still have a ways to go. <u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA>: Can you be _any_ more specific at all other than just "stabilize the infrastructure; making progress"?

I'm glad you've addressed it but what does that mean exactly - just more servers?  Changing how reddit works so that there's less stress on the servers somehow?  Buying more cloud service from Amazon?  Just bug-fixing?

If you can't say, that's fine, and I appreciate you answering the question at all, but _any_ kind of detail at all would go a very long way. <u/spez>: It's not just adding more servers. The specific short-term fixes involve looking for optimizations in code and addressing some glaring infrastructure issues: improving our internal caching, for example.

Longer term, we'll rewrite everything, one piece at a time. Organizing the rest of our stack so this is possible is the first step. We need to get to more of a [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture).
