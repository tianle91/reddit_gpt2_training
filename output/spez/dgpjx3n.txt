Title: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Body: Hello r/cscareerquestions, I’m Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you’re on Reddit! And, yes, [we’re hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

Q: [deleted]
A: 1. In the beginning, we didn't have a vision. Every day we worked on what we felt like each day. One one hand this was a good thing: the site came from a pure, organic place. One the other, we didn't have a long term vision to focus us, which is why we sold so early. 2. Hash passwords. 3. Spend time with my friends. Ski. Read Reddit. Read books. 4. Test your assumptions. Have a bug? Make sure all your assumptions about the surrounding code are correct. Fix a bug? Make sure you can reproduce it and fix it again. Even if it seems like a waste of time, it's a good use of time.
