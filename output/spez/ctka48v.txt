Title: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

Body: I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!

Q: What do you think?
A: Spez, seven years ago, you made this commet in regards to hatesubs, as seen here: [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd) Why the recent change in policy?

A: While my personal views towards bigotry haven't changed, my opinion of what Reddit should do about it has. I don't think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I'm sure our thinking will continue to evolve.
