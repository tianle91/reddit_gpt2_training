<r/announcements>: Reddit Mobile Apps

**tl;dr**: I’m new, we’re launching two apps today in the US, UK, Canada and Australia: [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), send us your feedback, we’ll keep making them better for you. AMA!

### Hi everyone!

I’m Alex–I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I’m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I’ve been a Redditor for eight years and it’s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What’s New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans—there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We’ve made progress on many fronts since I’ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we’ve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We’ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We’re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

So here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we’ve built for you.

### What’s Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we’ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we’ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We’d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I’ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

Thanks!  
Alex

**Noon PT Edit:** Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team – we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.

**11PM PT Edit:** Ok I've been answering on and off all day. I will keep reading top comments but will be replying less now.  <u/[deleted]>: [deleted] <u/spez>: Every app is featureless compared to AlienBlue. Seriously, I learned about new hidden features just this morning.

This is just version 1! More to come.
