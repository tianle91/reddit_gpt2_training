<r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! <u/Rebelius>: Why is the front page so slow to update now? I used to come here for breaking news, now a shooting doesn't show up on the front page until the next day. <u/spez>: We need to update constants in the hot algorithm, but after the the mistake we made a couple months ago (We were fixing another bug and unintentionally affected the front page. It's since been reverted, but that's what got this conversation started.), we want to make sure we test things better. In order to do that, we need to rebuild the testing infrastructure for the front page, which is nearly finished.

Longer-term, we've outgrown the current algorithm and need to devise a new one. We've got a lot of ideas here. It's just a matter of time / engineers.
