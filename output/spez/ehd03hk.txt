<r/modnews>: Rule management on new Reddit

Hey everyone,

We’re excited to bring you rule management on new Reddit today! This encompasses the creation, editing, and deletion of rules, where changes will be reflected on both new and old sites.  

The Rules page can be accessed through your subreddit’s mod hub, under the “Rules and Regulations” section. One new feature on the Rules page will be **rule reordering** via drag-and-drop, so you no longer have to delete everything and re-add rules. If you reorder a rule on the new site, the change will be reflected on the old site, without you having to delete and re-add them. We hope this makes your life a little bit easier when making edits to rules in your community! 

Some things to note: 

* We’ve increased the maximum number of rules per community from 10 to 15.
* We’ve increased the character limit of rule short names from 50 to 100.
* We’ve increased the character limit of rule report reasons from 50 to 100. 
* Rule numbering has been added to the old site to reflect the new site. We did this to reduce the confusion of double-numbering, and the work of having to add numbers to rules. This will also maintain consistency for rules throughout Reddit’s communities, making it easier for users to understand.

Try it out and let us know if you find any wonkiness! As always, thank you for your feedback and help.  <u/admrltact>: Is this similar functionality going to be deployed to the removal reasons page / module?   <u/dmoneyyyyy>: We are planning a greater overhaul of the removal reasons feature — I'm actually going to start writing up a spec for it very soon. I'm curious, what specific functionalities are you looking for?  <u/admrltact>: Re-ordering for sure.
  
My rules page is:  
Rule 0  
Rule 1  
Rule 2  
Rule 3   
    

My removal reasons page is:  
Rule 3a  
Rule 3b  
Rule 0a  
Rule 0b  
Rule 1  
Rule 2  
We dont have a rule, but should  
Rule 3c  
  
This is the order they display in the drop down list when selecting a removal reason too. <u/dmoneyyyyy>: Got it. Reordering for removal reasons seems pretty reasonable to me! <u/admrltact>: Now that I've got you reeled in with a reasonable demand...  
  
A free pony for every mod <u/dmoneyyyyy>: u/spez says yes <u/spez>: Here's a couple to get started: 🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎

If this keeps them quiet, we can invest more.
