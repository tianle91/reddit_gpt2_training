<r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven’t done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We’ve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we’re hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and–of course–hiring.

I’ve got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. <u/The--Marf>: Even though you are an Admin what do you enjoy most about Reddit as a User?  Sorry for the kinda vague question. <u/spez>: I love posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/4jqvlf/reorganizing_the_subreddit/) that I couldn't possibly explain to anyone else, but still make me laugh til I cry.
