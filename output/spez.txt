<|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I‚Äôm starting to believe everything I learned in relation to coding/software is inherently useless and it affecting my life

[deleted]

<u/spez>: Coding is a really valuable skill.

Have you considered volunteering and teaching it to others? I've personally found fulfillment in helping others learn to code. It's fun and free.

Incidentally, one of the people who helped me learn to program was doing so because he head a disease that was going to render him braindead in ten years, so he decided to give back by teaching others. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/wholesomememes>: Wholesome wolf

<u/spez>: What up <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/CasualConversation>: Reddit is such a rollercoaster for me.

I keep being happy then angry then sad, because of the posts and the variaty of subs that im subscribed for. Sometimes i think about quitting the ones that makes me mad, but i also think that this is just closing my eyes to reality and just wanting to see nice things idk. What you guys think?

<u/spez>: I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/NatureIsFuckingLit>: üî• Photographer captures the real-life Jaws image

Basically the title. I know a lot of problems have similar solutions or principles. I'm just curious if there is a place I can go that will progressively help me learn almost like a study plan. Some times I feel like I try a problem and there is just too much context missing.

<u/spez>: I used to turn to the [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) when learning a new language.

I recently went through a rough patch in my life and i was really sad about what happened but now i realized it was for the best. So i just want to let everyone know that they matter and that it does get better.

<u/spez>: Whenever I go through a rough patch, I try to remember all the rough patches I've been through already, and all the high points and happy memories in between them. Then I remind myself that every rough patch has so far eventually been followed by good times and that whatever it is, this too shall pass. And it does. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/CasualConversation>: I feel like I don‚Äôt have any ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù and it‚Äôs bothering me

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve just been a dumbass in my whole 19 years of living but this past week I‚Äôve taken a step back from my friendships to examine them and honestly most of them don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù, if that makes sense. In particular, this one group of friends I‚Äôve been around since high school. They will from time to time invite me over to hang out with them or when they have a party they‚Äôll tell me to get over there, but when I‚Äôm actually there it feels a bit disingenuous. Just little interactions, if another guest at their house gives me a hug cuz we haven‚Äôt seen each other since graduation a couple of them will follow suit. which feels extremely forced considering they don‚Äôt normally do that and I see them way more often than the guest in particular. That coupled with the fact that it doesn‚Äôt rlly feel like anybody wants to make plans with me on the off chance I ask because I assume they are my friends. It also seems like the friends I made in college are the same way, where they originally sounded like they wanted to meet up this summer, whenever I actually talk serious about it nobody wants to say when they‚Äôre free. It just makes me feel like perhaps I‚Äôm just somebody nobody really wants to be around.

<u/spez>: I think I read this on r/wholesomememes a while ago, but it's stuck with me:

*The secret to having good friends is to be a good friend.*

You can't control their feelings and actions towards you, but you can control your feelings and actions towards them. If you make the effort, give them a call, plan things, invite them, I suspect you'll find what you're looking for, whether clarity or friendship. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: Will I get stuck if I accept this first job opportunity?

I know this question is vague, but I appreciate any advice you have for me.

<u/spez>: >I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing

It's hard to find this, so I'd give strong consideration to staying.

And what does it mean to be stuck? You'd only be stuck if this was the only job available, and if this is the only job available, you have no options anyway.

<u/kerblaster>: What if op is interning at Reddit?

<u/[deleted]>: Wait how does the karma system work then?

<u/CurlingFlowerSpace>: The first time you up/downvote a specific user, it's supposedly worth +1 (or very close to it). But for every time after that, the value goes down, so your second up/downvote of that same specific person might be worth .75+, and .5+ after that, etc.

<u/spez>: In the beginning...

It was one upvote for one karma point. That's still the basis, I believe, but just as post and comment scoring have some restrictions to prevent cheating (e.g. IP limits), karma scoring has even more.

The biggest gap between karma scoring and post scoring is we undid a (outdated) restriction on post scoring that is still on karma scoring. u/keysersosa wrote a post about it a couple years ago.

u/keysersosa, correct me if I'm wrong, but in theory we could bring karma scoring in line with post scoring if we weren't so busy otherwise ruining Reddit and whatnot. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/CrossStitch>: [CHAT] The CEO of Reddit likes us!

<u/spez>: To echo many people here, yes, that‚Äôs been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. 

Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). 

I find that simply walking is not enough. It‚Äôs running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/NintendoSwitch>: I'm a 'grown ass man'. I am getting a switch on Friday and its like reliving my childhood.

Hi all, just wanted to share something that might make some of you smile. Would be fun to hear if you have had a similar experience.

I‚Äôm 32. I have been gaming avidly for over 25 years, PC gamer and not had a console for over a decade. I‚Äôm a fully adult human. I have a mortgage. 

It‚Äôs my birthday on Friday and I am buying myself a switch. I cannot believe the level of excitement and impatience I am feeling. I feel like every minute is an hour, I keep imagining various terrible scenarios which result in me not getting the switch on Friday ‚Äì it breaks, the TV doesn‚Äôt work, Friday just DOESN‚ÄôT arrive. I am constantly watching youtube videos, planning exactly what I will do when I get it ‚Äì what order I will get digital games in, what Nintendo online membership I will get. Made an online account weeks ago‚Ä¶ This will be the longest work week of all time.

I was thinking ‚ÄòI actually can‚Äôt remember ever feeling this level of anticipation‚Äô, then I remembered I had ‚Äì as a child on those Christmas mornings getting the NES, SNES, PlayStation. The whole anticipation is bringing back so many happy memories of gaming as a child: watching my brother beating the final boss of Mario World on the SNES; playing chucky egg and grannies garden on the BBC Micro (anyone remember those?). There is something about the word ‚ÄòNintendo that just takes me back to another time and conjures a boyish excitement in me.

I am therefore doing everything possible to both heighten this excitement and increase the torture.

The great irony is that I already have my switch and the games and accessories. I am a ‚Äògrown ass man‚Äô, I have bought this with my own money and could open it any time I wish. No one would care. Instead I am forcing myself to wait until my birthday. I have even made a wee pile of the switch and everything else I have bought in a prominent place in the living room where it can torture and tantalise me. I am speaking to all my colleagues in work who have switches. Never off this reddit.  My girlfriend finds this extremely amusing and is ribbing me mercilessly about it, which is part of the fun.

There is so much negative reporting about gaming in the media so I wanted to share how much I am enjoying the sense of pure fun, joy, and excitement. I feel sorry for people who don‚Äôt know how rewarding gaming can be. 

This Friday morning ‚Äì I am opening my switch in my dressing gown at 7am like its Christmas morning 1997. Christmas f'ing morning for a 32 year-old, slightly greying, small child.

<u/planningsiti>: This is how i felt whe buying the switch. Im 27 and have been gaming since i was really young. Ive jad a faming pc for over 8 years and buying the switch and playing zelda breath of the wild made me relive moments i had when i was a younger me playing ocarina of time.

<u/spez>: Video games were a huge part of growing up for me until World of Warcraft, which was so rich and deep that I effectively fell out of gaming after I stopped playing because everything else felt hollow. Until Zelda BOTW. It was the first game in a decade that brought back the fun and excitement of gaming as a kid. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I work in an open office and am wondering if using music to block out sound is counterproductive

I work in an open office. I like my coworkers but their little noises drive me insane. One guy whistles cheerfully all day, another guy eats all day and chews like a cow, another has severe coughing and throat clearing tics, one guy laughs like a donkey every few minutes, etc.

Unfortunately, music, even instrumental music, distracts me like crazy too. I like music way too much and get lost in it. I‚Äôm aware I can wear earplugs but it‚Äôs not right for me.

So I‚Äôm curious about you guys - what‚Äôs the lesser evil? Listening to music, or your noisy coworkers?

EDIT - thanks for the suggestions, you guys are awesome! lo-fi and brown noise work like a charm.

<u/spez>: When I was programming every day, one of the things I was thankful for was having a job that allowed me to listen to music all day, not to mention the effect that music I loved would have on my mood, so there were benefits beyond just drowning out outside noise.

One technique that worked well for me was to listen to the same couple of albums over and over. While the songs had words that could otherwise be distracting, I had listened to them so many times that they effectively became white noise for me.

<u/The_Evil_King_Bowser>: If you respond to this comment with "bruh" I will try using New Reddit

Hi all,

You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently‚Äîthese are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.

As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.

# What Are Community Awards?

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

[A highly decorated post on r\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=735a9a37bb33c8d2139d9982cd68908c920ed19f)

In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.

# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?

Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.

With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the ‚ÄúStar of Excellence‚Äù Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

Mods can access the Community Bank to give‚Ä¶

# Mod-Exclusive Awards

Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.

Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don‚Äôt need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.

* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium
* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium
* ‚Ä¶ and so on!

Here‚Äôs what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

# Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?

Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.

# Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?

Check out [our companion post on r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards!

We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards:

* They must comply with [Reddit‚Äôs Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy);
* They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
* They must be SFW.

# A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!

We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we‚Äôre seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!

Participating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!

<u/ImpeckablePecker>: I'm betting 6 months until Reddit starts offering to let users buy karma. Now that I have your attention, I want to say that regardless of your opinion on open borders, let's at least agree on one fact and stop clouding the waters: the majority of the illegal immigrants living in the US came for economic opportunity, not because they were seeking asylum.  Whether or not they should be deported is debatable, but let's at least stop with the falsehood that most of them are asylum seekers.

<u/spez>: I‚Äôll take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned.

<u/SupDos>: >	more benefits to having karma,

Good god please no, it‚Äôs already bad enough with karma whores and gallowboobs when karma isn‚Äôt useful at all, but if it actually did stuff it would be even worse

<u/spez>: For example, lowering rate limits, lowering prices, or other things that would be nice for someone who has contributed to their communities. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Introducing Community Awards!

Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.

Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don‚Äôt need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.

* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium
* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium
* ‚Ä¶ and so on!

Here‚Äôs what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

# Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?

Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.

# Great! How Do I Go and Create Awards Now?

Check out [our companion post on r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards!

We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards:

* They must comply with [Reddit‚Äôs Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy);
* They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
* They must be SFW.

# A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!

We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we‚Äôre seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!

Participating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!

<u/yeah_sire>: This seems just as useless as silver

<u/venkman01>: Community Awards give Coins back to the Community. Mods can use those Coins to give out Mod Awards (and months of Premium). Silver doesn't do that.

Our hope is that this is a fun feature that brings mods / users together, and creates another way to customize Communities.

<u/parlez-vous>: Our hope is that this ~~is a fun feature that brings mods / users together~~ increases our companies profitability now that we've landed tens of millions of dollars from new investors and they expect a return

<u/spez>: It‚Äôs possible for a feature to both be fun and generate revenue. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Introducing Community Awards!

**UPDATE (9/4):** Winners of the Coins Giveaway have been [announced below in the stickied comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/chdx1h/introducing_community_awards/eus5nc4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)! Thanks to all who participated!

Hi all,

You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently‚Äîthese are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.

As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.

# What Are Community Awards?

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

[A highly decorated post on r\/DunderMifflin, featuring Silver, Gold, and Platinum, as well as the new Community Awards!](https://preview.redd.it/fsqt84ep6bc31.png?width=1928&format=png&auto=webp&s=735a9a37bb33c8d2139d9982cd68908c920ed19f)

In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.

# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?

Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.

With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the ‚ÄúStar of Excellence‚Äù Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

<u/ImpeckablePecker>: I'm betting 6 months until Reddit starts offering to let users buy karma. Now that I have your attention, I want to say that regardless of your opinion on open borders, let's at least agree on one fact and stop clouding the waters: the majority of the illegal immigrants living in the US came for economic opportunity, not because they were seeking asylum.  Whether or not they should be deported is debatable, but let's at least stop with the falsehood that most of them are asylum seekers.

<u/spez>: I‚Äôll take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/politics>: We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist. Ask us anything!

Hi, we are Senator Ron Wyden (Oregon), the author of Section 230, and Steve Huffman, CEO of Reddit. We're here to explain how Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act  (‚ÄúCDA 230‚Äù) allows sites like Reddit to exist, and how the law empowers Reddit and every other platform on the internet to take down bad content without being tied up with endless lawsuits.

Sometimes called [‚Äúthe twenty-six words that created the internet,‚Äù](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414)  the key concept of CDA 230 is simple: it says that when you make a post on a platform like Reddit, you are the speaker of that content, not Reddit. 
You can learn more about how CDA 230 works [here at this breakdown](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And you can read more about Senator Wyden‚Äôs efforts to defend it [here](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/16/18626779/ron-wyden-section-230-facebook-regulations-neutrality).

<u/SouthernJeb>: Hello  /u/senatorwyden, I have a two part question:

1) Do You support Mr. Huffman's decision to allow subreddits such as The_Donald to continue to have a presence on the site, despite continuous sharing and posting of questionable and subversive content? Why/Why not?

2) As Reddit has grown into a huge website for discourse, do you feel that sites such as this are obligated to remove nefarious/questionable accounts (i.e. foreign-state sponsored) along with questionable content? Why/Why not?

<u/senatorwyden>: Mr Huffman has the First Amendment right to support whatever content he chooses to, as does any private business. And other users have the right to choose whether or not they want to associate with a site that hosts that kind of content. 

From what I am told, The_Donald is home to messages that cross the line toward inciting the hatred that is eroding our democracy and it would be good to see Mr. Huffman and Reddit to do more work to moderate such behavior. 

on #2 - While they're not legally obligated to do anything, any American site should remove any foreign state-sponsored content, whether it is Russian bots, or Chinese deniers of the Tiananmen massacre.

<u/spez>: Thank you, Senator.

As it relates to r/the_donald specifically, we watch them closely, and we do our best to hold them to the same standards and policies as we do all communities. Before we action any community, we also speak to moderators regarding rule breaking behaviors. To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.

Yes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.

I wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the community‚Äîcertainly it would make some things easier‚Äîbut the reality is that banning a large political community that isn‚Äôt in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.

I know this isn‚Äôt the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/politics>: We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist.

<u/tom2day>: OK so lots of questions but not much, if anything in the way of answers. Let me try...I know it is a tricky road but what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles? Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

<u/spez>: >what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, we‚Äôve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and we‚Äôve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (n√©e brigading) that are in alpha testing, and we‚Äôve built a new ‚Äúreliable reporter‚Äù system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

>Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/politics>: We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist.

<u/jews4beer>: We seem to be encroaching (if not already fully entrenched in) the tools of democracy being weaponized in a way that we haven't been up against before. The foundations of freedom on the internet are being levied to mount massive disinformation and influence campaigns. 

Despite all of that, internet freedom is still immensely important albeit extremely fragile. What are some ways we can tackle the spread of disinformation and foreign political interference while still safeguarding the free flow of speech and information. For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions? For Ron Wyden, what can we do legislatively to hold company's that don't act in good faith accountable while still not harming the freedoms of others to be innovative in their business practices?

<u/spez>: >For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddit‚Äôs greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isn‚Äôt news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/politics>: We are U.S. Senator Ron Wyden and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, here to talk about how Section 230 allows sites like Reddit to exist.

<u/[deleted]>: Senator, do you think requiring users of online communities to "self-moderate" is appropriate in this era of disinformation, or should sites employ stricter controls to limit the spread of disinformation?

Hey everyone,

We‚Äôre excited to bring you rule management on new Reddit today! This encompasses the creation, editing, and deletion of rules, where changes will be reflected on both new and old sites.  

The Rules page can be accessed through your subreddit‚Äôs mod hub, under the ‚ÄúRules and Regulations‚Äù section. One new feature on the Rules page will be **rule reordering** via drag-and-drop, so you no longer have to delete everything and re-add rules. If you reorder a rule on the new site, the change will be reflected on the old site, without you having to delete and re-add them. We hope this makes your life a little bit easier when making edits to rules in your community! 

Some things to note: 

* We‚Äôve increased the maximum number of rules per community from 10 to 15.
* We‚Äôve increased the character limit of rule short names from 50 to 100.
* We‚Äôve increased the character limit of rule report reasons from 50 to 100. 
* Rule numbering has been added to the old site to reflect the new site. We did this to reduce the confusion of double-numbering, and the work of having to add numbers to rules. This will also maintain consistency for rules throughout Reddit‚Äôs communities, making it easier for users to understand.   


[The new Rules page.](https://preview.redd.it/hxy9tgrz7yi21.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa8f96155ab90708718dead288578389c09baef6)

Hi all,

Today we‚Äôve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We‚Äôve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn‚Äôt disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And‚Äîof course‚Äîwe do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I‚Äôll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

<u/Norci>: Question, a bit offtopic. What is Reddit's stance on subreddits using bots to auto-ban users for participating in certain other subs? Will any actions be taken against that, or is it allowed. 

<u/spez>: We don't like it, but we haven't provided an alternative solution. They live in a grey area.

One thing we're going to make better use of is the idea of "community karma." It'll be useful for helping communities grow safely while keep trolls and abusers at bay. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

Hi all,

Today we‚Äôve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We‚Äôve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn‚Äôt disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And‚Äîof course‚Äîwe do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I‚Äôll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

<u/WorldsBegin>: You said you received 1 request to remove content from a governmental entity in the United States. Can you be a bit more specific as to what topic this request was concerned with? I try to understand what content might warrant this outlier.

<u/IgnisSorien>: Hi Spez,

Copyright seems to be a big issue for many large websites, especially YouTube, and I see daily posts about YouTube acting unfairly. It looks as though Reddit's DMCA requests are increasing exponentially.
It looks at though each request at the moment is viewed manually. I'm concerned that as the rate of requests increases, this process may be automated and the human aspect of the reviewing process (e.g. Fair use) may be lost. What's in the pipeline for Reddit for this requests?

<u/spez>: Presently, we're comically (and frustratingly) manual. The team the handles DMCA requests is the team that wrote the Transparency Report, and it is a LOT of work.

We're working on tooling now to automate much of the tedium, but humans will remain in the loop. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

<u/thebiglebowskiii>: Hi Steve, I'm one of the authors on the [recent CSCW paper](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~eshwar3/uploads/3/8/0/4/38043045/eshwar-norms-cscw2018.pdf) studying moderation and community norms on Reddit. I'm glad that our paper was useful to explain Reddit's multi-layered architecture for moderating content and the norms that develop. Look forward to going through the transparency report in detail!

<u/spez>: You just outed yourself on Reddit, you brave soul!

LOVED the paper. I thought your approach of comparing models across communities to find common sentiments was really clever, and I'd love to see us incorporate that into Reddit itself. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

<u/spez>: > Will you ever modify or remove content to appease your new Chinese investors?

No

> Can you commit to never doing so?

Yes

<u/FreeSpeechWarrior>: How can we trust that when reddit once said:

> We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States - because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it - but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on reddit. Now it's just reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse

Clearly this promise has been broken as countless subreddits have since been banned for content legal in the US.

What makes your promise now any more believable?

<u/spez>: These words, which were not mine, were in defense of sexualized pictures of young girls. Child porn is a real crime in the United States, and sexualizing minors is an adjacent behavior, and not only is it not welcome on Reddit, it's explicitly forbidden.

I have made many arguments in my career in defense of Free Speech and continue to do so, but there are limits, and this is one of them. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

<u/ginosanti>: Why do I have to opt-out of the redesign over and over again?

And which moron came up with it anyway?

<u/spez>: > Why do I have to opt-out of the redesign over and over again?

This is a hugely annoying and embarrassing bug. We believe we've fixed most of the causes, but to be certain, we've rewritten the entire system that directs traffic to the old site vs the new site to both work as expected and to be a lot faster, and that should launch soon (days, not weeks)

> And which moron came up with it anyway?

Me. We wanted to both bring new users to the new site but also give all users a choice indefinitely, which made things technically complex.

That said, we are all frustrated that we didn't do a better job here.

<u/Cycloptichorn>: Maybe this is a silly question, but was there any real research done on whether the changes being made in the redesign were changes that new users actually *wanted?*  If so, how was this information gathered?  Were these changes targeted towards attracting specific demographics, for advertising or other purposes?

Thanks for answering questions, the users appreciate it

<u/spez>: Not a silly question at all. We did a ton of research during design and development, and we continue to do so. We bring people into the office, run surveys, and run a lot of online A/B tests.

Overall, the redesign retains new users at a much better rate than the original site. One of our most important metrics is D1 retention: how many users come back the next day after visiting the site for the first time.

<u/Halaku>: >ii) Foreign Requests (Non-Emergency)
In 2018, Reddit received 28 requests for the production of user account information from foreign governmental authorities (excluding emergency requests). Reddit did not comply with any of these requests.

I noticed that the specific foreign governments are unlisted in either the posted summation above or the actual Report.

Is there a legal reason why the governments were unlisted?

Wouldn't transparency be better served by saying "X from Canada, Y from the UK, Z from Russia, and 1 from Vatican City", or something like that?

<u/Sanlear>: What are you planning to do with the money you‚Äôve recently raised? Besides keeping Reddit running I assume, are there any specific goals in using it?

<u/spez>: In the immediate future, nothing. One of the risks of raising a lot of money is that it can be disruptive to strategy and culture, so we will overcompensate by aggressively sticking to our pre-funding plan.

Down the road, it does give us flexibility to take bigger bets or try new things, but we don't have any specific plans.

<u/Searchlights>: If you don't make any changes, how will you deliver ROI to those investors?  Reddit is known to make a much smaller amount of annual revenue per user than are other social media platforms.

<u/spez>: We're working on a lot of stuff right now. Pretty much every aspect of Reddit is under some sort construction, and we're seeing a lot of nice progress. Even compared to a couple months ago, Reddit is faster; we've added a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Changelog%20%3Asnoo_hearteyes%3A%22&restrict_sr=1) of [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/); and have made quite a bit of progress on the Anti-Evil / Security side of the house (a post about which will come on Friday). 

So, even if we don't do anything new, we're making plenty of progress already, and I don't want to derail that. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We‚Äôve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn‚Äôt disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And‚Äîof course‚Äîwe do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I‚Äôll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

<u/The-HilariousFingers>: Just out of interest. From the perspective of a large company how difficult has/was adapting to the EU's GDPR regulation been?

<u/spez>: It's not easy, but mostly because government regulations often don't factor in the technical realities of their implementations.

That said, it's easier for us than others because we don't actually have a lot of non-public data about our users. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

<u/TheBatsford>: Who are you selling my data to and how can I know who you are selling my data to on an ongoing basis?

<u/spez>: We don't sell any private user data, though we do sell access to an API to more easily access already publicly available content.

How you data is used is documented in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy-may-25-2018).

<u/Dustin->: >we do sell access to an API

[Different than the publicly accessible API?](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) And if so, what's the difference?

<u/Sanlear>: What are you planning to do with the money you‚Äôve recently raised? Besides keeping Reddit running I assume, are there any specific goals in using it?

<u/spez>: In the immediate future, nothing. One of the risks of raising a lot of money is that it can be disruptive to strategy and culture, so we will overcompensate by aggressively sticking to our pre-funding plan.

Down the road, it does give us flexibility to take bigger bets or try new things, but we don't have any specific plans. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2018 transparency report (and maybe other stuff)

<u/bigshot937>: Hi Steve. What do you have to say to the members of the Reddit community who have expressed concerns about Reddit taking on Tencent as an investor?

<u/spez>: It's a fair question to ask. Tencent is a global investor who have invested in many [successful internet companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent#2011%E2%80%932014:_Early_investments).

Downvoting abusive, off topic, or inaccurate posts improves the quality of the content, but anecdotally I observe that downvotes to seem to be used to indicate disagreement overwhelmingly more often.

So what this ends up doing, as I‚Äôm sure anyone here has already thought about, is disincentivizing minority opinions, and also longer more thoughtful comments in general as well as sincerity in general as opposed to sarcasm.

Anecdotally, what I experience is that downvotes make Reddit seem toxic and unpleasant and incentivize brief sarcastic exchanges which are also toxic and unpleasant. What do you think?

E: the opinion seems overwhelmingly that it‚Äôs bad. Interesting that the feature exists. There must be a reason.

<u/spez>: A couple years ago, I was wondering this exact question.

Ups and downs are something we've had since *nearly* the first version of Reddit (but not the very first version: early iterations had words instead of arrows, but words were too subjective and restrictive).

Anyway... a couple years ago I considered the idea that downvotes were purely destructive, and that we'd be better off without them. My reasoning was that it feels bad to receive downvotes, and getting downvoted is an especially poor experience if you're a new user. If our goal is to make Reddit more welcoming and accessible, we were working against ourselves. Also, downvotes are weaponized by users and communities to harass and brigade, further compounding the problem.

However, despite their flaws, downvotes are a critical tool for communities to develop and maintain their voice, and without them we couldn't scale moderation. There are only so many moderators and far fewer admins, and by allowing community members to moderate content in a lightweight way, they can develop their own identities and voice and keep out the junk (most of it at least).

I know downvotes have their flaws, but they've been critical to growth of every large subreddit, making addressing their flaws supremely important. Improving downvotes is one of our current initiatives, and hopefully you'll feel the changes in the coming weeks if you haven't felt them already. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/Showerthoughts>: The CEO of this site could have an account where he just blends in with everything else.

I made a post a month ago saying I found a fix and it got over 200 upvotes, but the post ended up being confusing because I was mistaken in what I thought the problem was. I can see that it hasn't been fixed still.

However, I actually found a fix after taking another look.

When you open a post, the #overlayScrollContainer element receives focus, presumably for accessibility reasons. For whatever reason, this element having focus causes the lag (20 fps scrolling). If you click anywhere on the container once it's open, the performance issue vanishes until you close it and reopen another post. Something to do with focus is causing the issue. 

[I notice that there's another inner div also with `tabindex="-1"` within the scrollable container.](https://i.gyazo.com/2e671e874ab51e2716a7cb752b8ba74f.png).

**If you give the focus to this inner element instead of the parent scroller, there is no performance issue.** (Scrolling becomes 60 fps). I assume there is no problem with accessibility here because the Lightbox scroller is still in focus, it's just the direct child of the element with the overflow-y rule.

Here's some code you can paste in the console while navigating between posts.

    setInterval(() => {
      const scroller = document.querySelector('#overlayScrollContainer')
      if (scroller) {
        console.log('Applying scrolling fix')
        scroller.firstElementChild.focus()
      }
    }, 10000) // <-- 10 seconds; change to any number in ms

Hopefully this actually solves the issue now and Safari scrolling can finally be fixed!

<u/spez>: Well this is a nice surprise. Works for me.

In September of 2016, r/politics moved to an 'Exact headline only' rule, after several months of discussion among the moderators, and across meta threads between April to August. In order to make enforcement of the new 'exact headline' rule possible, a bot service was created to match headlines to the articles... which was turned off shortly thereafter due to an unsustainable false positive rate. The mod team discovered that the headline metadata across many sites was simply too inconsitent to enforce with automation effectively - some sites left their organization name in, some had a page title separate from the headline, some had malformed titles or no headline data at all. So we moved to manual enforcement of the rule. 

Overall, the mod team believes that the state of r/politics titles is more consistent, and less likely to mislead readers than the previous title rules. But it has remained extremely rigid and strict as a carry-over from when the rule was written to accommodate our bot service - which we never managed to get running the way we had intended. We're often missing additional information and context from the article subhead or subtitle. We're also handicapping websites that use an artistic or short primary headline, in favor of more descriptive subheads. So, starting today we are making the following changes

**Subtitles are now allowed in submission titles**

The title rule will now be updated as follows:

>Submissions must have titles comprised of the exact copied and pasted headline from the article, and may use the subtitle / subhead at your discretion. Do not include the organization name, extraneous quotes, or the article section. Do not add, remove or change words from either the title or subtitle - with the following required changes:

> * If the headline AND subtitle/subhead *together* exceed the character limit for reddit titles, you may only use the primary headline.

> * It is strongly suggested that subtitles or subheads should be marked by separating it from the headline using a dash (`-`), vertical bar (`|`), semicolon (`;`) or other appropriate non-attention seeking punctuation character. Any punctuation that could alter the meaning of the title will be treated as rule breaking.


**Articles without any headline at all will use a structured title format**

In cases where a web page has no headline whatsoever, a structure following the rules below must be used.

>In rare cases where you wish to submit a link and the content is acceptable for r/politics, but there is no headline on the page, you must use the following style for the submission title:

> `Publishing organization, body or group`, `published date`, `Title of document or page`

> Examples of this style in practice: 

> * [Department of Justice, 2018-7-13, Case 1:18-cr-00215-ABJ](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download)

> * [FiveThirtyEight, 2018-10-19, 2018 Senate Forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/?ex_cid=midterms-header)

> * [State of Alabama, 2017-12-12, 2017 Official General Election Results](https://sos.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/voter-pdfs/2017%20Official%20General%20Election%20Results%20without%20Write-In%20Appendix%20-%202017-12-28.pdf)

###Rehosted content

Another change we are implementing is a change to our "rehosting" rule. For a long time, we have tried to actively remove articles which were overly reliant on content taken from other sources - block quotes, video clips, transcripts etc. The intent was to steer users to the original source for stories, and as a side effect, increase the story diversity on our front page. However this has long been one of our hardest rules to enforce - it can go hours before being detected, and there are a plethora of grey areas and uncertainties that moderators have encountered while trying to keep enforcement consistent.

After review of 2 months worth of our "front page" removals which totaled 462, 144 of them were for removed for "rehosted content", making up 31% of those removals. It was second only to "Off-Topic" removals which totaled 261. 21 of the "rehosted content" removals made it to #1, so to put it in perspective we pulled (at least for those two months) 10 #1 submissions for rehosting each month.

**Our new rule for "Rehosted Content" will read as follows:**

>No copy-pasted articles

>Please do not submit articles or videos that are a direct, complete copy-paste of original reporting. Articles or videos that add another take on a subject, or include different verbiage or context are allowed.

There was a lot of debate about this one. On one hand, it may lead to more similar content on the subreddit or the front page in cases where Megathreads are not applicable. However, we will also be removing less content which will make for a more user-friendly experience as we generally want to remove the least content that we can from users. We want to watch the impact of this change carefully to see how it performs, and would like to get your feedback on how the rule may change your experience reading r/politics. 

_______

The two above changes will be the focus of this meta-thread, but we expect there will be a lot of other things to discuss. Below is a brief Q&A, which will link to some top level comments below for longer discussion threads. If you could help us keep the thread organized by discussion area, it would be appreciated. 

###Q&A


**Q**: *What is the current policy on brand new users to r/politics?*

If you were reading carefully, you may have noticed a message in our bot sticky message letting the community know that users with less than 100 karma were being temporarily muted as a trial to see if it resulted in less trolling and malicious behavior. After conducting an analysis, we determined that we weren't happy with the effectiveness of that rule and have since made it much less aggressive. We know there were a couple of users lobbying to try this approach - we found that the rate of false positives was simply too high. In a random sample of collected removals, we found that as many as 70% of removed comments were non-rule breaking, which was far out of line with our intended result. After looking at the results, we are now much more confident that positive karma simply is not a good predicator of good behavior. 

That said, we did increase the aggressiveness of our negative karma gate mute rules, which remain in effect as of now. We're still discussing if the false positive rate of removals for those conditions is acceptable. We may have more indepth discussion below. 

**Q**: *There are websites on the domain whitelist that I don't think should be there. Why can't we remove them?*

**A**: In August of 2017 we moved from a domain blacklist - which targetted rule breaking domains - to a domain whitelist - that approved generally rule compliant domains. At that time, we were very sensitive to the impact of making this change, and were determined to make certain that the whitelist was not a round-about way of trying to curate our front page, or push submissions in a different ideological direction than what users were interested in submitting. To guide us, we created a 'domain notability' requirement, which would ensure that any domain that was sufficiently influential or remarkable would be permitted. 

A year and a half later, we're extremely happy with the impact of the whitelist system. It has *dramatically* reduced the amount of spam and obvious rule breaking content that we have submitted to us. Things that were once incredibly commonplace - advertising spam, Macedonian fake news / click-bait websites, blogs, Youtube promoters etc - are now made instantly irrelevant. This has made r/politics/new much easier to browse, and has let the moderator team focus our efforts elsewhere - on enforcing comment guidelines, removing trolls, removing off topic content etc etc. There are many domains that we receive regular complaints about - their content may be inflammatory, controversial, or spurious. The fact is that we were very actively trying *not* to target those domains when moving to this system. We want to make user voting - the core mechanic that all of reddit is based around - the primary method of curation on our page. We still feel confident that our approach is sound - but of course we will discuss further below. 

Please (for the love of all that is holy) try to remember - inclusion on the whitelist is **not** an endorsement by the mod team or r/politics, or a reflection of reputability. Is is *solely* reflective of whether the domain is *notable*. 

**Q**: *I'm unclear or unhappy with the comment rules. What kinds of comments do you remove?*

**A**: You can read all the [comment rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/index#wiki_be_civil). First and foremost however - please never under any circumstance make any comment which wishes physical harm on anyone for any reason. And I know it's troubling on a couple levels that we have to now specify this: 

* Quoting people suggesting physical harm as a way to make the same implication is not a neat trick for evading this rule. Do not use direct quotes in order to imply or condone physical harm.
* Do not make 'suggestions' for capital executions unless we've entered the sentencing phase for an active trial in which that may be relevant. 

Beyond comments that incite, condone or wish harm, we aggressively prune comments that are uncivil towards others, or are intended to troll or flame other users. Comments of this nature could be removed from the thread, and repetitive behaviour of this nature may result in a ban from the subreddit.

###We would like your feedback!

**Midterms**

Midterms are always a very busy time for the subreddit! This year, as you may have noticed, we did something interesting by having individual threads for each state, a stickied thread linking to those threads, and an overarching megathread for general discussion. We would like to know what you did or did not like about the format, what could be improved, what could we do differently?

**Themed threads**

Our current "themed" threads are scheduled as follows:

Sunday - Satire Sunday

* This thread is intended for users to be able to post things that fall under our general "no satire" rule. Clips from satirical shows like SNL, or articles from sites like The Onion.

Monday - What happened in your state?

* This thread is intended for users to post political stories of interest in their respective states.

Friday - Fun Friday

* This is a thread to just decompress and have fun!

Saturday - Political Cartoon thread

* As the name suggests, this is a thread to share political cartoons.

We would like to know, do you enjoy these threads? Do you have suggestions for other interesting threads?

**Chat**

Reddit recently added a chat feature for communities. Our own community chat has grown to over 13,000 subscribers! Anyone is welcome to join and participate. If you're subscribed to r/politics, it should show up in your recommendations. It will also show up on the sidebar of the redesigned site.

Chat has the same conduct rules as the subreddit. 

We've taken on a handful of chat-only moderators to help keep the chat friendly and open. Huge shoutout to the help we've been getting from our chat moderators - along with a large number of incredible new mod team volunteers we've added to our subreddit team.

Since chat is so new, we're still figuring out how it should be run - it is very much a new experiment for us. We'd love to hear your ideas and feedback on how we can make the chat experience useful and fun for our users!

<u/spez>: This is great. There are some really good ideas in here that we might be able to make easier for you.

For example, what do you think about a feature to sync headlines (maybe automatically, or automatically add a flair and allowing a mod to edit?). This has always been complicated for a variety of reasons (title shenanigans on Reddit, and inconsistent publishers), but I think your specific use-case might be a good one to work with to make things easier, whether fancy tech or manual mod editing.

<u/ecafyelims>: >what do you think about a feature to sync headlines

That'd be fantastic, spez! ETA?

<u/spez>: I'll chat with the team. Unfortunately, I'm no longer allowed to write code over Thanksgiving. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/politics>: r/politics Fall 2018 Meta Thread - Rule changes for submission titles, article subtitles, rehosted content and more

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: Yep. Come say hi. 

<u/Sandbag_Tom>: I find it kind of weird, you know, that you‚Äôre responding to this comment in a thread which criticizes you heavily for ignoring some major issues.

It seems clear to me the commentator you respond to is saying he can‚Äôt wait for your live AMA because you won‚Äôt be able to ignore the obvious /r/t_d questions you are here and in your earlier AMA.

So your comment here, while innocent on a surface level... sort of feels a little taunting, you know? And that worries me.

Because you‚Äôre either intentionally taunting users... or you‚Äôre just a little tone deaf on how to communicate with the userbase.

Ultimately I love Reddit, despite the shortcomings and current issues it faces... but this sort of behavior worries me a little bit. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what you bring to the table in the future, though. I‚Äôm optimistic for the future of this corner of the internet.

<u/spez>: Sure, I can see how one would interpret it that way. Let me provide another way of looking at things:

Whether in an AMA or interview or in person, not only am I happy to answer hard questions, I generally look forward to it. It's in my nature to do so, often to my own detriment ([example](https://new.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5go62/)), but I do look for questions that meet two criteria: questions that are asked politely, and asked in a manner that suggests the questioner will actually attempt to listen to my response (even if we have zero chance of agreeing).

In my AMA yesterday, I didn't see much of either, especially as it relates to r/the_donald. I did attempt to leave a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75s1o8/) [responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75wos8/) on the topic, and I have attempted to other respond many times in the past, but since my answer is never "yep, they're getting banned," I end up buried. So it goes.

It's really isn't my intention to ignore people. I'll probably do another AMA in the near future, and if someone wants to ask simply "why don't you ban r/the_donald?" I'll do my best to answer honestly and politely, though my answer will probably look a lot like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/dth6eq9/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=announcements).

Anyway, long story short, if u/2Grateful2BHateful or any of you want to say Hi this weekend, I'm more than happy to chat about this or anything else. It'll be fine, might even be pleasant.

Hello again!

It‚Äôs been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I‚Äôm always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you‚Äôve probably noticed that over the past few months we‚Äôve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We‚Äôve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we‚Äôre working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We‚Äôve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we‚Äôve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we‚Äôve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to‚Ä¶ night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven‚Äôt checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can‚Äôt imagine we have much to talk about, but I‚Äôll hang to around some questions anyway.

‚Äîspez

<u/ploggingdev>: 1) Can you please stop pushing the redesign so hard?

2) Can you stop the "Download the app" popups showing up so frequently on mobile?

3) Can you stop employing dark patterns such as [this](https://www.ploggingdev.com/images/dark_login.png) ? Email is optional and should be made clear.

4) Can you remove the [orange coloured chat icon](https://i.imgur.com/IXzbY36.png) next to my inbox?

Complaining aside, I continue to enjoy reddit, thanks!

<u/spez>: 1) What are you referring to? Only new users see it by default. Most everyone else needs to opt in.

2) They've been gone a while, but we are chasing down an issue with incognito users seeing it more often. Please let me know if that's the case, or if you are having a different experience.*

3) Historically it has been optional, and it technically still is, though we're reconsidering it. While I was the original proponent of no-emails, we've found it to be problematic for a couple of reasons over the years: lost account passwords take time for our team to resolve, no emails makes tracking abuse more difficult, and there's more pressure than ever to fight such abuse, and it's generally helpful to be able to reach users where they are with important notifications.

4) Have heard this one before, and we're considering a couple other approaches. I didn't notice myself because my icons are always orange.

*Update: there was a lingering experiment that is now turned off.

<u/stpfun>: > 2) They've been gone a while, but we are chasing down an issue with incognito users seeing it more often. Please let me know if that's the case, or if you are having a different experience.

Mobile app prompts have been gone for a while? I see an [aggressive prompt](https://imgur.com/izp56QO) EVERY TIME I use Reddit on iOS Safari, not incognito.

There are some mild prompts, but the big issue is the full-screen popup that appears every time I try to click on comments. I must click "Not Now" on this modal every time I refresh Reddit or visit an external link.  It does not remember my preference at all.

Here are screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/9CGGwK4

Have someone on your team try to use Reddit's mobile website for a week and see what they think.

Hello again!

It‚Äôs been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I‚Äôm always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/).

<u/ChuffyBunny>: A couple of CEO posts ago, a big deal was made about the reddit canary being taken out indicating that Reddit as a company now had to conform to federal inquisitions for user data. Usually this means that a tool is made for federal investigators to gather data needed for whatever case they are working.  

So how are you as a company taking active measures to protect users data from similar breaches like what happened to Facebook, Equifax, and more recently; Apple, Uber, and Amazon. 

<u/spez>: Breaches do happen, even to the best, as you point out. We've had a couple over the years, one of which we [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) a few months ago.

In addition to the standard best practices, we have a philosophical approach to storing as little personal information as possible. With limited exception, we don't know your names, addresses, genders, dob's, phone numbers, ssn's, or other sensitive information. We can't lose what we don't have.

I've always liked the saying "the best logs are no logs," which I believe came from the EFF. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/MercurianAspirations>: So, the recent quarantine wave:

/r/CringeAnarchy

/r/theredpill

/r/watchpeopledie

/r/ice_poseidon

/r/braincels

/r/FULLCOMMUNISM

/r/911truth

/r/mayo_town

/r/FragileJewishRedditor

/r/SubOfPeace

/r/WhiteBeauty

/r/White_Pride

/r/GentilesUnited

/r/ZOG

/r/GoyimDefenceForce

/r/AganistGayMarriage

/r/WhiteNationalism

/r/NorthwestFront

As many redditors have noticed, one of these things is not like the others. r/watchpeopledie is well-moderated not devoted to hate speech or hoaxes. Actually they are quite zealous in their moderation and removal of hate speech. On the other hand, it did present advertiser-unfriendly content that reddit likely didn't want new users stumbling upon. So what exactly is the purpose of quarantine? Either: 

1. Quarantine is for subs like r/watchpeopledie, ugly but well moderated communities that are allowed to stay on Reddit but need to be hidden away because of capitalism

2. Quarantine is a punishment for hate subs used to encourage them to reform or leave the platform.  

If quarantine is being used primarily in a #2 way, why not just ban these subs? Hate subs are not going to reform their moderation policies, or stop brigading other subreddits no matter what quarantine you place them under. In fact all you've done is give them a safe space, subsidized by the non-quarantined subreddits, where they can continue to discuss their ideology and organize brigades of public subs. 

<u/spez>: (some of this I wrote elsewhere in the thread, but it's also relevant here)

In addition to updating the policy, we updated the tool as well. We may use it for both of the cases you mention.

The first version of quarantine was basically a death sentence for a community because it required community members to have verified email addresses. We decided that if we want to ban a community, we should just do so outright.

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

All quarantined communities continue to be subject to our site-wide content policies. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/BestRbx>: Afternoon from the UK Spez, /r/funny here! Was a pleasure speaking to you during the London Roadshow.

What are we working on to combat the karma farming epidemic? politics and russian trolls aside, there's been an abhorrent amount of sheer shitposting cluttering up the default subs.

I understand we could code plugins or algorithms to sustain an improved automoderating system, but that sets a rather high expectation of knowledge in programming, as well as a volunteer willingness to work on something so extensive.

All of us default mods are hugely grateful for the improvements your teams have made to ease our burden a bit, but some of us feel there's still a ways to go before we get to stop spending all of our free time scooping buckets of water out of the ocean.

Edit; great response. And to everyone who seems to have a hard time understanding how /new works and instead chooses to abuse the mods, try keeping up with a twitch chat during a live esports tournament with no bottleneck to slow the message rate.

Now imagine that 24/7.

Now imagine filtering, tagging, banning, tracking groups, and responding to messages at that pace. 

Your abusive attitude towards those who volunteer their time to battle such a seemingly hopeless cause with no reward but their own understanding that they get to help the community should embarrass you.

<u/spez>: Thanks for the question, and thanks for hanging with us. Help is coming.

We know these kinds of accounts have been a problem, and they‚Äôre not easy for moderators to deal with alone. We‚Äôve talked a bit elsewhere about a relatively new team we‚Äôve spun up to deal with content manipulation. While their focus has been largely on political manipulation, many of the same tools and methods they‚Äôre developing are also effective against these kinds of spam networks. As those things work their way into production, we hope you‚Äôll see far less of these accounts in your subreddits.

One of the specific focuses of the Anti-Evil team going forward is to "reduce janitorial work" for our team and moderators alike.

Similarly, improved tools that don't require as much technical knowledge are on the roadmap. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Update: I've got to take off for now. I hear the anger today, and I get it. I hope you take that anger straight to the polls next month. You may not be able to vote me out, but you can vote everyone else out.

Hello again!

It‚Äôs been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

<u/Wild_Marker>: Last time there was an admin post, we from /r/argentina complained about the advertising blitz we've received from Monsanto. Their ads are misleading, they claim to be from reputable websites then redirect to another. Our mod team has repeatedly reported it, so have our users, we're sick of seeing it over and over and OVER AND OVER AGAIN. It's like the only ad you see if you have an Argentinian IP. It's nuts. Please please do something about it or at least acknowledge the problem. 

I know Monsanto is a contentious subject but forget politics, we're just sick of being bombarded by the goddamn ads. 

<u/spez>: The advertiser was banned a while ago, and we've been watching for any additional accounts. Please do continue to report the ads if you see anything.

Why have you been dragging your feet on this?Why have you continued to **actively aid** the spread of [disingenuous paid propaganda](https://old.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/9hu52u/the_donald_is_actively_promoting_russian/) ?

Why do you continue to push "new reddit" when it absolutely sucks in terms of wasted space and shit performance?

<u/spez>: You're linking to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9ksmno/simply_put_the_democrats_are_a_party_of_terrorists/e71ziol/) that was removed by mods before it got any traction on a post that was also removed mods.

As long as the mods of that community continue to cooperate with us in enforcing our site-wide rules, they're not going to see a ban.

<u/FreeSpeechWarrior>: > As long as the mods of that community continue to cooperate with us in enforcing our site-wide rules, they're not going to see a ban.

That didn't stop you from quarantining (soft ban with the current implementation) r/watchpeopledie

If quarantine wasn't intended to be a soft ban it would function more like NSFW and be globally bypassable via user opt in.

If it was treated as a label for users to control their own experience I'd be all for it.

<u/spez>: The first version of quarantine was basically a death sentence for a community because it required community members to have verified email addresses. We decided that if we want to ban a community, we should just do so outright.

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

All quarantined communities continue to be subject to our site-wide content policies. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello again!

It‚Äôs been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I‚Äôm always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you‚Äôve probably noticed that over the past few months we‚Äôve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We‚Äôve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we‚Äôre working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We‚Äôve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we‚Äôve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we‚Äôve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April.

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven‚Äôt checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can‚Äôt imagine we have much to talk about, but I‚Äôll hang to around some questions anyway.

‚Äîspez

<u/stillpiercer_>: Hi, /u/spez!

I have a very simple question that many, many of us would love an answer to. 

Why the fuck is /r/The_Donald still around, and why did the Reddit admins go out of their way to nuke the post that that guy made pointing out the Russian interference within that sub?

<u/spez>: **as it relates to the_donald**

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

This does not mean we are not going to enforce our content policy on the_donald, nor does it mean we don't expect full cooperation from the mods in doing so.

**regarding the Russian interference post from a couple weeks ago**

We didn't remove anything. The [user removed the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/9hqzb5/rfuckthealtright_mod_made_a_detailed_post_of_his/e6e4dzf/), and resubmissions of that post were removed as spam because some of the domains in the post were subsequently banned by us. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers!

<u/lelinc>: During the last election cycle, we saw fraudulent scams by Russian Hackers. How does Reddit plan to protect itself from these hackers to keep itself from being the next Facebook or twitter?

<u/spez>: We're strengthening the measures we have in place to limit the impact of any malicious actors. 

Here are a few of them:

* dedicated teams that enforce our policies, proactively go after bad actors, and create eng solutions to prevent them in the future,
* a new team specifically devoted to investigating efforts to manipulate our site,
* we‚Äôre working on improving communication to/from this team with a trusted reporter system and increasing our presence in subreddits where users are already investigating suspicious activity \[link: [investigations@reddit.zendesk.com](mailto:investigations@reddit.zendesk.com)\], 
* working with industry peers (and parts of the government working to ensure election security) to help us detect and stop emerging malicious activity
* As we‚Äôve always done, we‚Äôll also have an in-house "war room" monitoring for suspicious activity around election day.

In the meantime, transparency is also critical, to help educate users and the public about techniques bad actors are trying out. We've been forthcoming about suspected influence campaigns with you (recent examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/)) and will continue to do so as needed. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers!

We‚Äôve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we‚Äôre working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We‚Äôve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we‚Äôve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we‚Äôve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to‚Ä¶ night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven‚Äôt checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can‚Äôt imagine we have much to talk about, but I‚Äôll hang to around some questions anyway.

<u/abovebetweenbelow>: What do you actually do as the CEO of Reddit?

<u/spez>: I spend the majority of my time doing four things:

* Working with our product teams to improve Reddit, which these days is focused on how do we make Reddit more accessible to new users
* Recruiting
* Communicating internally to the company about what we're doing and why we're doing it
* Taking my lumps with the community, which is what I'm doing right now <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Update: I've got to take off for now. I hear the anger today, and I get it. I hope you take that anger straight to the polls next month. You may not be able to vote me out, but you can vote everyone else out.

Hello again!

It‚Äôs been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I‚Äôm always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/).

<u/shirleyUcantBserio>: Detailed posts have shown r/the_donald being responsible for pushing russian propaganda through use of coordinated bots and bogus fake articles.

r/the_donald also frequently participates in hate speech, including but not limited to: anti-muslim rhetoric, violence surrounding neo-nazi rally in 2017, death threats against John McCain and others, etc.

When will you address this issue? When will you stand up to attacks on our democracy by Russia, specifically propagated through a community on your site?

edit: here‚Äôs the post outlining r/the_donald‚Äôs rampant violation of reddit rules. sorry trolls :p

http://archive.is/qIDX7

also notice it‚Äôs an archive, because certain reddit mods were scared of the truth and deleted the original

<u/spez>: My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) documented exactly what we know and what we're doing about foreign influence on Reddit. We also listed the accounts that were involved so that you can see for yourself what they were up to.

In August, we wrote a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/) regarding an Iranian attempt at manipulation.

A couple weeks ago, we saw another round of posts centered around usareally.com, which is now banned. What we found in this case was that the users behind it were indeed of Russian origin, though we have no technical evidence that they are affiliated with the IRA. Similar to the IRA's previous efforts, this group's efforts were largely not effective: They submitted 953 posts to 130 different communities. Of the 264 posts submitted to r/the_donald, only one made it into the top 100, and 0 made it into the top 25.

We have a team dedicated to finding and preventing coordinated behavior to manipulate Reddit. The first question whenever we find anything is, "what could we have done to find this sooner?" In this case, we would have liked to have caught and banned the domains sooner because they were behaving in a spammy matter, and have adjusted our processes to do so going forward.

If you do find anything of this nature, please send it to directly to investigations@reddit.zendesk.com.

<u/Zaorish9>: When are you going to ban huge subreddits that constantly have [upvoted calls to violence](https://removeddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9ksmno/simply_put_the_democrats_are_a_party_of_terrorists/e71ziol/?st=jmtuiqw2&sh=1d3b8138) that their mods ignore and that violate all your sitewide rules? Why have you been dragging your feet on this?Why have you continued to **actively aid** the spread of [disingenuous paid propaganda](https://old.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/9hu52u/the_donald_is_actively_promoting_russian/) ?

Why do you continue to push "new reddit" when it absolutely sucks in terms of wasted space and shit performance?

<u/spez>: You're linking to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9ksmno/simply_put_the_democrats_are_a_party_of_terrorists/e71ziol/) that was removed by mods before it got any traction on a post that was also removed mods.

As long as the mods of that community continue to cooperate with us in enforcing our site-wide rules, they're not going to see a ban. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers! Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/spez>: We dialed that way back a couple weeks ago. It should be just a little button now.

One thing that might be happening for folks is seeing more prompts because they use incognito because we're losing the cookie that stores whether they've seen the prompt.

Hello again!

It‚Äôs been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I‚Äôm always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you‚Äôve probably noticed that over the past few months we‚Äôve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We‚Äôve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we‚Äôre working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We‚Äôve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we‚Äôve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we‚Äôve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to‚Ä¶ night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven‚Äôt checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit.

<u/drumber42>: Do you take to heart the thousands of posts outlining why people hate new Reddit?

<u/spez>: We do, in fact. We wrote a [lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/9iu1ax/we_conducted_an_opt_out_survey_on_new_reddit_here/) about how we collect and respond to feedback just last week.

tl;dr: about 70% of user are on the redesign, and the top two complaints are "change aversion" and "performance".

Long story short, we hear it, we see it, and we've been working hard to make the redesign great. The top priority for us right is performance, and we've made quite a bit of improvement over the last month. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: You have thousands of questions, I have dozens of answers!

<u/WacticalTank>: Will you ever remove /r/the_donald?

<u/spez>: EDIT:

Your original comment was:

> What is one thing you which you had introduce to reddit sooner but didn't.

You've since edited it to be about r/the_donald. It's disingenuous to edit your comment after I've answered and not admit that you did so.

My original answer:

One thing we really haven't nailed yet is onboarding. We have incredible breadth and depth in our communities that isn't well represented in r/popular, which is what new users see when they first arrive to Reddit. I think we can do a much better job highlighting what Reddit's all about. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: Making it easier to host events

Hi Mods,

We‚Äôve been working on a few things to make it easier for you to host events for your communities. Over the last week, we‚Äôve invited a few mod teams (see comments for the list) to start trying them out as a beta, so we wanted to let the rest of you know what‚Äôs up as well.

# Why are we doing this?

Many people come to Reddit during events‚Äîwhether it's an AMA, a TV show premiere, a sports finale, or [another newsworthy development](https://redditblog.com/2018/07/12/thanosdidnothingwrong/). The problem is that it‚Äôs hard for users to find these events (both when they‚Äôre happening and when the next one is occurring) and even harder for mods to host and manage them using our existing tools.

Solutions like AutoModerator scheduler aren‚Äôt super accessible or easy to use for mods who aren't already AutoMod wizards, and other hacks communities have used to manage events have shown us where our tools could be improved.

# So, what are the features?

We're building a suite of mod-only features to solve these problems:

* **Event post metadata**: This gives mods the ability to [add start/end date/time information to posts](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izc0y/add_event_data/). Users can see the start/end time from listings pages and on the posts themselves and ‚Äúfollow‚Äù the events. In the coming weeks, following the event will send them an app notification when the event starts.
* **Post submission scheduling:** This gives mods the ability to schedule when a post should be submitted. The first version of post scheduling will be event-focused with options to submit now or submit at event start time only.
* **Post collections:** This gives mods the ability to [group posts together in a community ‚Äúcollection‚Äù](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izc6i/collection_mod_flow/). Users will be able to view and switch between [posts within a collection easily](https://new.reddit.com/user/0perspective/comments/9izbxn/collection_demo/). They can share a collection URL, which will automatically direct them to the in-progress/most recent event post (e.g., if I made a collection of pre-, live- and post- game threads for last week‚Äôs Notre Dame v Wake Forest college football game and you clicked the collection URL, it would open the post- game thread. If I clicked that same link when the game was in progress, I‚Äôd see the live- game thread). That said, you can still easily get back to the other posts in the collection as well.

We‚Äôve broken event metadata, post scheduling, and post collections into separate features because we believe they have broader utility than the Events-specific use case and want to give mods flexibility as you test these out. Our goal for each of these is to reduce the amount of time/effort you put into hosting an event on Reddit and to make it easier for more mods to help host. As we evaluate these features, we may decide to invest more in some and less in others. Your feedback will help us prioritize this and we‚Äôll keep you posted along the way.

# I want to try it out, how can I?

We‚Äôre testing these features out with a few mod teams and going to launch a series of improvements over the next month or so. For now, you can [join our waitlist](https://goo.gl/forms/dgs8p2jD73ZahhIi1). We‚Äôll enable more mod teams periodically.

Thanks,

u/0perspective

UPDATED 3/14:

We've made a few Event and Collections endpoints available for our beta communities to start trying out and giving us feedback on. You can read more about these APIs here, https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/. 

<u/likeafox>: Yes we like this. Can you talk about different use cases you have envisioned for the post collections tool? Will the collections have an exposed public API? 

<u/0perspective>: For different use cases, we're really excited to see the creative use cases the communities come up with. Some idea we've talked about internally a few

\-- All the discussion threads for seasons 2 of Game of Thrones

\-- Best 401k advice

\-- This weeks best OC

\-- Chronicling the developing news like (Hurricane Florence)

\-- Eventually we could see mod teams use this for megathreads.

**What ideas do you have?**  


As for API access, it's something we're considering this during the beta. **How would you use API access?**

<u/shiruken>: Back when /r/science hosted AMAs, collections would have been perfect for organizing our themed AMA weeks.

<u/spez>: We hope so. r/science AMAs were one of the inspirations for this feature. The idea is you can create a landing page for an AMA days before the event to build up excitement, and then bring everybody back at the same time for the actual event. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/Drama>: Time to monologue at you.

[removed]

<u/[deleted]>: Can we still ping /u/spez? And oops. 

<u/spez>: I can handle it.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/inthesoulstone>: An update on going private

We would like to formally apologise to everyone r/inthesoulstone for the lack of communication & delay regarding going private.

We know you are pissed and you have every right to be. You all have been demanding to go private for so long now. And no, we haven‚Äôt forgotten about it. We admit, there have been quite a few hiccups along the way but the good news is we've managed to solve most of the problems, except for one. The Reddit API limits the amount of approved users to 200 per hour. In theory, that would take around 40 days to manually approve 230,000 souls. In addition, the mod team would also have to clear and archive 230k+ modmails, each of it being a notification that the user is now an approved submitter in the subreddit. We would rather take a quicker path.

Quite a few people here have wrongly assumed that manually approving 230k+ souls shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. If that‚Äôs the case, let me make it absolutely clear that we have a mod team consisting of 8 people, with each of them having their own personal lives to attend to. It‚Äôs just not practically possible, yet we are still considering it as an option but of the last resort.

We have been trying to get in touch with the Reddit admins regarding our API issue but haven‚Äôt yet received any response in return.

We are also aware of the fact that the bot has stopped responding to the ‚Äú!snapme‚Äù command and we're working on fixing it.

At last, If anyone here has any other ideas they would like to bounce off or any solutions they would like to share, please do let us know in the comments below.

Let me try: https://www.reddit.com/comments/8u9vhi

EDIT: Shit I was close

<u/the-crotch>: What you're describing is a self post, there's a button for it

<u/FreeSpeechWarrior>: This was actually the origin of self posts, they were not originally a reddit feature, but users created the feature by guessing the link to their own post.



<u/RunDNA>: This is true. Here are the two earliest known self-posts:

6 Jan 2006:  https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/24912/ask_reddit_were_can_a_student_get_internshipstyle/

16 Jan 2006: https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/27353/recursive_reddit_self_link/

<u/spez>: There are also a bunch of examples of users guessing wrong, which created all sorts of hilarious confusion.

The first version of text posts required the user to type ‚Äúself‚Äù in the url field to create it automatically. 

These days, text posts make up about half Reddit‚Äôs submissions. Beyond subreddits and comments, it was probably the most significant feature we built.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/LickingThings>: Inaugural reddit licking. Spez approved.

<u/spez>: Sigh... approved.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: Has r/popular caused the loss of actually discussion on Reddit for new users (and by extension, all of Reddit over time)?

Edit - sorry about the typo, phone keyboard. Please don't spam r/titlegore in the comments

Back when the site had a list of curated defaults, new users were exposed to a variety of quality topics and communities that delivered a great deal of quality discussion 

Now with r/popular the user experience is almost entirely driven by comedy and memes since this content gets a quick reaction from the most users and thus the highest ranking on the site. Content with more substance doesn't reach users who aren't already subscribed to these subreddits.

I don't have a good example off the top of my head but when a non comedy oriented sub his the front page, it's almost always just because somebody posted a meta meme that gets the most laughs.

Is Reddit going to continue to let this happen? You can say that users have the option to go find subs to subscribe to, but I really think this is a loss of the quality discussion Reddit was once known for.

<u/ggAlex>: You might be right. We noticed this too and have been looking into it. We will have more to share soon.

<u/spez>: Dang I was just writing a reply to this as well.

There is no style around the link that this user posted. Meaning, old school websites would have the text blue and underlined. For what it is worth, that style is preserved when I go to the page with all of my comments, but not within the subreddit itself. Is this a subreddit specific style, or a global setting? \(Either way, I hope it can be rethought. I read the dude's comment with a fine toothed comb, making sure my tired eyes were not missing a link. The only thing I did \*not\* do was literally mouse over those two words...\)

<u/spez>: I was just about the tell the team about this one as well. Underlining markdown links would be nice. For some themes, the color choices make links in comments and posts basically invisible. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/redesign>: After 3 months of negative comments about inline ads, are there any statements about how they are going to change?

From what I can see, disguising them as posts is only generating animosity towards the advertisers.

<u/spez>: The ads will change. While they will stay inline, we are going to try a few more versions. The trade off of course is that if they stand out too much, they‚Äôre distracting, if they are too subtle, they‚Äôre deceptive. We‚Äôre trying to find the right balance.

I'll spare you our excuses for while we haven't been more responsive on this particular topic, but suffice to say we can do better on the communication, and I'll work on that as well. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: Expectations from a new grad and how to improve?

I recently interviewed with a startup (small, 10-20 engineers) and was given a timed take home assignment. I have just graduated college with a B.S. in CS from a top 15 school with an average GPA and two past internships. My Github page has a bunch of projects. (none of them would be considered production quality though) After the take home I was told that although they were impressed with my ability my code style and quality weren't up to the par with production quality code. The problem I encountered was that the take home had a very specific problem and creating an extensible solution proved to be difficult. How can I improve myself in that aspect? How does one improve the "production quality" level of their code without being on the job and learning from others? This may sound like a rant but I genuinely want to improve and hopefully work with this company in the future.

The "best" sort should actually help communities like r/science get more visibility. That's the whole point. Though it's not really relevant right now since their AMA shenanigans predate any algorithm changes. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/science>: r/science will no longer be hosting AMAs

[4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1vqimu/announcing_the_rscience_ama_series/) we announced the start of our program of hosting AMAs on r/science.  Over that time we've brought some big names in, including [Stephen Hawking](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/), [Michael Mann](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1yj3o7/science_ama_series_im_michael_e_mann/), [Francis Collins](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/4gcwwy/science_ama_series_i_am_francis_collins_current/), and even [Monsanto!](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3b6mr4/science_ama_series_im_fred_perlak_a_long_time/).  All told we've hosted more than 1200 AMAs in this time.


We've proudly given a voice to the scientists working on the science, and given the community here a chance to ask them directly about it.  We're grateful to our many guests who offered their time for free, and took their time to answer questions from random strangers on the internet.


However, due to changes in how posts are ranked [AMA visibility dropped off a cliff.](https://imgur.com/a/Xf3F1m0) without warning or recourse.


We aren't able to highlight this unique content, and readers have been largely unaware of our AMAs.  We have attempted to utilize every route we could think of to promote them, but sadly nothing has worked.  


Rather than march on giving false hopes of visibility to our many AMA guests, we've decided to call an end to the program.

<u/PHealthy>: Wonder if u/spez cares that Reddit is losing a well loved feature.

<u/spez>: The decision for r/science to no longer host AMAs is disappointing, and blaming us at Reddit is counterproductive.

u/nallen, having met you personally a number of times and after personally trying to work through this issue with you over the past months, I'm disappointed you've taken this approach to mislead your community about what's going on.

So here's what's really going on:

**How it used to work**

r/science used to be a default community, which means it was one of one hundred communities that made up the front page of Reddit for most of 2011‚Äì2016. As a result, r/science and the other defaults had high visibility at the expense of non\-default communities.

r/science used to promote AMAs by removing other more popular posts so that the AMA could be top of r/science without the votes. This, combined with being a default community, sent a lot of traffic to these AMAs.

**How it works today**

We replaced the defaults with r/popular, which is basically a SFW version of r/all. This puts all communities on an equal footing.

We don't allow the post manipulation for obvious reasons. Here is a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/77o0wm/friday_discussion_thread_what_unique_challenges/donto0j/?context=3) we had with u/nallen on this topic months ago.

We are indeed testing new sorting algorithms, but if anything they should help communities like r/science get more visibility. One of our engineers recently wrote a [pretty good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8kf5wm/reddits_first_pass_ranker/) about it.

**Going forward**

Regardless of u/nallen's decision, we will continue to work to improve our onboarding and sorting so that users get to see more of what they love, and we have in mind some specific features that will help promote "event" posts \(AMAs, game threads, episode threads\) in the future. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: Why did they change the reddit to new reddit?

[removed]

<u/spez>: You can use the old layout indefinitely. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and uncheck "use the redesign as my default experience." I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. 

As for why:

1. New tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. [Here's our most recent update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8jgu1q/51518_release_notes_inbox_count_post_flair/)
2. Easier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 2‚Äì5x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.
3. Adapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100&#37; outbound links and self\-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.
4. Ads. In\-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in\-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.
5. Perception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with "old and difficult to use" isn't good for business.
6. Portable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.

We've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant "feedback" is highly motivating to the team.

Personally, I've switched my desktop Reddit\-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy. I'd encourage folks to give it a try. If you don't like it, opt\-out and hopefully check back in in a month. It's updating rapidly. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: If you created a Reddit-type website, would you implement shadow bans?

[deleted]

<u/spez>: If we knew everything everything we know today about spam, enforcement, and transparency, we probably wouldn‚Äôt build shadow-banning. It‚Äôs use is really limited to spam, and I think the downsides (false positives, lack of transparency) outweigh the benefits. 

That said, it was useful in the early days when spam was more of an arms race, we didn‚Äôt have moderators or reporting, and our content policy was limited to spam. 

<u/Brownt0wn_>: Do you find yourself using it less and less frequently?

<u/spez>: It used to be the only way to ban. We still use it for spam, though I‚Äôd like to phase it out long term. Today we have more tools, bans, timeouts, wrist slaps. Another problem with shadow bans is that it makes it difficult for others to audit our work: even if we ban something, there‚Äôs little evidence we did.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: If you created a Reddit-type website, would you implement shadow bans?

Reddits frontpage consists of posts from your subscribed subreddits. Since people can subscribe to over 200+ subreddits, instead of Reddit showing you a post from each one it chooses a random list of 50 or so subreddit and shows you posts from them. Every half hour or so it chooses 50 different random subreddits. 

Or atleast thats how it used to work. In the past, whenever I visited Reddit.com, my frontpage was filled with a completely random selection of the various subreddits I subscribed to over  the years.

Recently, however, I have noticed that it seems like Reddit is keeping track of what subreddits you are visiting and showing you more of those algorithmically. It is no longer random. For example, if I visit the /r/yugioh subreddit out of the blue and spend some time on it, for the next week, /r/yugioh will always be in my list of 50 subreddits for the frontpage, especially if I reinforce it by revisiting it every time it shows up. 

Is this a known change that has been announced somewhere?

<u/spez>: Yes. The "Best" sort on your home feed is the new version of the algorithm\(s\). We're constantly running tests here with the goal of surfacing content from your subscriptions that you're more likely to engage with. It also removes content you've already seen, which creates the appearance of much faster turnover.

The old algorithm, which was effectively a random selection of top posts from your subscriptions, is still accessible under "Hot."

<u/Animate_XOR>: Is there going to be an effort to communicate these changes with the wider user base? Additionally I find on social media websites with similar ways of filtering content it creates a sort of feedback loop where one page or group ends up dominating your timeline and crowding everything else out, hopefully you guys have come up with some ways of mitigating this effect.

<u/spez>: Here's one of the [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7spgg0/best_is_the_new_hotness/) from when we first started rolling it out.

As for creating a feedback loop, Reddit is different from other sites in that your Home feed is comprised of communities to which you've explicitly subscribed, which makes that effect less likely to happen unless a user intentionally does it to themselves. That said, we do look at others online as cautionary tales. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: Reddit recently implemented some sort of tracking "algorithm"?

<u/iBleeedorange>: have you guys noticed any changes to reddit since rolling out "best" as default? Votes lower/views lower on posts since posts change more often? If they are, do you think that's good or bad, or irrelevant?

<u/spez>: Votes, comments, and posts per user are up by 15&#37;. Time on site and retention is also improved. It's rare that just about every metric we care about goes up. This is presumably because users are seeing relevant posts.

Anecdotally, I see a lot more r/TheoryOfReddit posts, which I'm happy about. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: Reddit recently implemented some sort of tracking "algorithm"?

It's that time of year again where you get off the internet and into the [foggy] sunshine. 

This year's San Francisco Reddit Meet-up Day will be June 9, in [GGP at the Old Speedway Park](https://goo.gl/maps/DymvoUY8Y9N2). Time is 12-4:30, just like last year. And similar to last year, there will be free swag and free food provided by reddit :) Benefits of being the hometown team! 

See you there!

tl;dr, in case you missed it, /r/nfl scrapped their CSS in protest of the redesign rollout and while we understand and agree with their decision, it doesn't make sense for /r/hockey to participate during the playoffs. We do however share the same concerns with all of the major sports subreddits about this redesign.

[The /r/nfl mods made a better post than we could possibly hope, so if you have the time, please read it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8glmp1/rnfl_the_redesign_and_the_future_of_reddit/?st=jgqy74wp&sh=692fedad). 

A few changes that have us concerned:

##Flairs

Emojis will be replacing flairs and are currently locked in at 15 x 15 pixels, despite the recommended upload size being 128 x 128 pixels. On the legacy website, we use 30 x 30 for flair images which allows users to clearly see the team logos that they're representing but doesn't distract from the content.

In addition, with no indication of CSS continuing through to the redesign, we will have to drastically rework our flair system. [We have 1,326 flairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/flair/stats) (only 828 of them currently used ya ungrateful schmucks). The number we've seen thrown out as the flair limit is 300. We currently have 251 NHL flairs alone, and while I personally would love to get rid of /u/crazy_canucklehead's pooh bear flair, he assures me bodily harm if I do.

##Chatroom rollout

Reddit recently rolled out this chatroom feature as an opt-in thing. The modtools available are woefully lacking, reports don't go to the mods, and the expectation that we'll have the bandwidth to moderate this + our normal threads really isn't fair to the modteams. It *is* opt-in, but like many features we expect this to be a delayed rollout to everyone.

In addition we already have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZmmYu8) with a mod team that totally fucking owns. Seriously, huge shoutout to /u/Axepig and his team for all the work they do. 

##API support

The redesign really doesn't have much in the way of API tools. For the non-technical folks, these are interfaces provided by reddit that allow us to interact with the website directly from code. This may seem like a very nerdy thing to complain about, but a lot of the nice features available in the sidebar and top nav are enabled by this support. Tero has written a number of wonderful bots that provide stuff like updating schedules, brackets, box scores, etc. These are useful features we wouldn't want to deprive y'all from.

##Other random issues

* No Wiki support in the redesign. This is important both as informational tools, and for some of our internal mod tools. Here are a few examples:  
  - [/u/crazy_canucklehead's expansion draft writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/expansion_draft)
  - [/u/LAKingsDave's curated list of AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/amas)
  - [A list of recommended podcasts that really needs to be updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/podcasts) 

* No custom AMA/text flair. We hand out a quarterly text flair to a user every month as a thank you from the mod team for being a good member of the community. We also use it to signify AMA posters and some of the official team accounts. There's no support for this in the redesign.

* Minimal support in the way of RES.

* Automod support is lacking/absent. Automod is still running, but we have no way to configure it via the redesign. I can tell you up front that moderating a subreddit of this size will be near impossible without automod to handle the front lines.



# So where does that leave us

We're in the middle of the playoffs. We have no intention of joining /r/nfl in removing our CSS right now, as it would be incredibly unfair to y'all. That said, we would like to participate in this wider discussion. **Our intention isn't to get up on our cross, create some horrible internet witch hunt, or to prevent any kind of change.** Personally I totally understand the reasons for the redesign, and I think there's room for everyone to be happy. We as the volunteer mod team just want to share our concerns with the current trajectory of the redesign, and the potential downstream impacts to y'all as a community.

If you haven't seen it yet, a preview of the it may be found at https://new.reddit.com/r/hockey. **We cannot currently recommend the redesign as the preferred viewing method at /r/hockey**. If you would like to permanently (for now) opt out of using the Redesign, open your Reddit preferences and then scroll to the bottom and deselect "Use the redesign as my default experience." This will return your account to using the current version of Reddit without relying on the https://old.reddit.com url.

If you wish to follow along and provide respectful feedback about the redesign, you can do so at /r/Redesign. Like many of the sporting subreddits, we have seen many users throughout the various subreddits speak up for your concerns. We appreciate this. /r/hockey has always been user led and the most impactful feedback will not come from the mod teams, but the rest of the users. If you do give feedback, please be certain to specify your concerns, so the engineers will be most able to provide solutions. We will continue to work with what we have available to us (and to keep you all informed should we hear updates), but if you have any ideas on what we can do to improve the site or different ways to keep features currently threatened, let us know by replying here or sending us a modmail. 

Sincerely,

<u/Bigmaq>: /u/spez wants playoff hockey to have shootouts.

<u/spez>: I'll take a lot of shit on this site, but this I cannot stand for. I think they should remove a player from each side every 3 minutes of overtime until there's nothing left but two goalies.

As it relates to the redesign, thanks for the feedback. I believe most of your concerns will be addressed (e.g. flair). Chat is super early, that's why we're testing. And the wiki and automod work just fine. Not sure where that rumor started.

<u/[deleted]>: Honest question, did you run the design visually past anyone other than the admins? Is anybody actually telling you that the new design looks good?

<u/spez>: We've had thousands of testers over the past year of pretty much every variety: users, non\-users, in\-person, remote, prototypes, real code, quantitative, and qualitative. This in addition to the long\-running alpha with thousands of users for the past six months, and now the slow roll out to real users and optional opt\-in for many more.

Wired wrote a really good [piece](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-redesign/) about the whole process, and we wrote a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/) about it as well.

<u/[deleted]>: Again though, did people actually like it? Like from a business standpoint, it's obvious why y'all are doing this - and I know /r/redesign is going to be biased as fuck, and perhaps all the positive sentiments about it are getting downvoted, but I don't think I've seen any regular reddit users actually being a fan of the new look.

<u/spez>: Lots. r/redesign is hot right now with the sports stuff, but we've received lots of positive sentiment over the months as we've progressed. Still a long way to go, but I think we're on the right track.

Speaking as one of the oldest Redditors and the creator of a lot of the current Reddit, I love the redesign. I have my gripes, of course \(performance, mostly\), but I know we'll get there. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/hockey>: /r/hockey and the Redesign

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/Bigmaq>: /u/spez wants playoff hockey to have shootouts.

<u/spez>: I'll take a lot of shit on this site, but this I cannot stand for. I think they should remove a player from each side every 3 minutes of overtime until there's nothing left but two goalies.

As it relates to the redesign, thanks for the feedback. I believe most of your concerns will be addressed (e.g. flair). Chat is super early, that's why we're testing. And the wiki and automod work just fine. Not sure where that rumor started.

<u/[deleted]>: Honest question, did you run the design visually past anyone other than the admins? Is anybody actually telling you that the new design looks good?

<u/spez>: We've had thousands of testers over the past year of pretty much every variety: users, non\-users, in\-person, remote, prototypes, real code, quantitative, and qualitative. This in addition to the long\-running alpha with thousands of users for the past six months, and now the slow roll out to real users and optional opt\-in for many more.

Wired wrote a really good [piece](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-redesign/) about the whole process, and we wrote a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/) about it as well. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/hockey>: /r/hockey and the Redesign

tl;dr, in case you missed it, /r/nfl scrapped their CSS in protest of the redesign rollout and while we understand and agree with their decision, it doesn't make sense for /r/hockey to participate during the playoffs. We do however share the same concerns with all of the major sports subreddits about this redesign.

[The /r/nfl mods made a better post than we could possibly hope, so if you have the time, please read it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/8glmp1/rnfl_the_redesign_and_the_future_of_reddit/?st=jgqy74wp&sh=692fedad). 

A few changes that have us concerned:

##Flairs

Emojis will be replacing flairs and are currently locked in at 15 x 15 pixels, despite the recommended upload size being 128 x 128 pixels. On the legacy website, we use 30 x 30 for flair images which allows users to clearly see the team logos that they're representing but doesn't distract from the content.

In addition, with no indication of CSS continuing through to the redesign, we will have to drastically rework our flair system. [We have 1,326 flairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/flair/stats) (only 828 of them currently used ya ungrateful schmucks). The number we've seen thrown out as the flair limit is 300. We currently have 251 NHL flairs alone, and while I personally would love to get rid of /u/crazy_canucklehead's pooh bear flair, he assures me bodily harm if I do.

##Chatroom rollout

Reddit recently rolled out this chatroom feature as an opt-in thing. The modtools available are woefully lacking, reports don't go to the mods, and the expectation that we'll have the bandwidth to moderate this + our normal threads really isn't fair to the modteams. It *is* opt-in, but like many features we expect this to be a delayed rollout to everyone.

In addition we already have a [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZmmYu8) with a mod team that totally fucking owns. Seriously, huge shoutout to /u/Axepig and his team for all the work they do. 

##API support

The redesign really doesn't have much in the way of API tools. For the non-technical folks, these are interfaces provided by reddit that allow us to interact with the website directly from code. This may seem like a very nerdy thing to complain about, but a lot of the nice features available in the sidebar and top nav are enabled by this support. Tero has written a number of wonderful bots that provide stuff like updating schedules, brackets, box scores, etc. These are useful features we wouldn't want to deprive y'all from.

##Other random issues

* No Wiki support in the redesign. This is important both as informational tools, and for some of our internal mod tools. Here are a few examples:  
  - [/u/crazy_canucklehead's expansion draft writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/expansion_draft)
  - [/u/LAKingsDave's curated list of AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/amas)
  - [A list of recommended podcasts that really needs to be updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/wiki/podcasts) 

* No custom AMA/text flair. We hand out a quarterly text flair to a user every month as a thank you from the mod team for being a good member of the community. We also use it to signify AMA posters and some of the official team accounts. There's no support for this in the redesign.

* Minimal support in the way of RES.

* Automod support is lacking/absent. Automod is still running, but we have no way to configure it via the redesign. I can tell you up front that moderating a subreddit of this size will be near impossible without automod to handle the front lines.



# So where does that leave us

We're in the middle of the playoffs. We have no intention of joining /r/nfl in removing our CSS right now, as it would be incredibly unfair to y'all. That said, we would like to participate in this wider discussion. **Our intention isn't to get up on our cross, create some horrible internet witch hunt, or to prevent any kind of change.** Personally I totally understand the reasons for the redesign, and I think there's room for everyone to be happy. We as the volunteer mod team just want to share our concerns with the current trajectory of the redesign, and the potential downstream impacts to y'all as a community.

If you haven't seen it yet, a preview of the it may be found at https://new.reddit.com/r/hockey. **We cannot currently recommend the redesign as the preferred viewing method at /r/hockey**. If you would like to permanently (for now) opt out of using the Redesign, open your Reddit preferences and then scroll to the bottom and deselect "Use the redesign as my default experience." This will return your account to using the current version of Reddit without relying on the https://old.reddit.com url.

If you wish to follow along and provide respectful feedback about the redesign, you can do so at /r/Redesign. Like many of the sporting subreddits, we have seen many users throughout the various subreddits speak up for your concerns. We appreciate this. /r/hockey has always been user led and the most impactful feedback will not come from the mod teams, but the rest of the users. If you do give feedback, please be certain to specify your concerns, so the engineers will be most able to provide solutions. We will continue to work with what we have available to us (and to keep you all informed should we hear updates), but if you have any ideas on what we can do to improve the site or different ways to keep features currently threatened, let us know by replying here or sending us a modmail. 

Sincerely,

The Mod Team

Kickoffs: I love the idea of replacing them with 4th and 30 from your own 30. More exciting and safer.

No response from admins for 2 weeks. What the heck

Comment in question: https://i.imgur.com/DoX6HKc.png

Since it's a locked account approving, removing, or ignoring reports on this comment doesn't work.  It has been in modqueue for over 2 weeks now and we have had 0 on-topic responses from the admins (the only response was to talk to the mods of the subreddit to get our comment approved).  I'd settle for a "Thanks for letting us know.  We can't do anything because reasons" response, but have received nothing.  We've replied to our messages to them a couple times to bring it back up.  Still nothing.

Is this the kind of response we should expect from the admins going forward?

<u/spez>: Should be fixed now. Will dig in and see what happened. I think there was a miscommunication of what the problem actually was.

<u/ghqwertt>: I had a disturbing [thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussiaLago/comments/87ipcn/i_just_had_a_disturbing_thought_we_just_found_out/) a while ago and was hoping you could answer a question. Chris Wylie [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/palantir-worked-with-cambridge-analytica-on-the-facebook-data-whistleblower.html) investigators that CA shared its FB data with Palantir (Peter Thiel's company). He also said that there was no official contract.

I can't help but wonder if there was no official contract because it was part of a trade. Thiel is a major investor in Reddit. Perhaps he traded Facebook data in exchange for Reddit data? I bet CA or companies like it are dying to get their hands on what makes the base excited and the opposition depressed.

Has Reddit given its data to Thiel or to any other known political actor?

<u/spez>: No. That's nonsense.

Do you have a bot or something that replies with this to everything I write? If so, turn it off. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: Can't get rid of frozen account's comment in modqueue. No response from admins for 2 weeks. What the heck

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich

<u/spez>: The funny thing is I'm not actually a prepper. It's true, I do own a couple guns, have had eye surgery, and am into motorcycles, and it's true those things would come in handy if society collapsed, but really what happened with that article is I thought I was talking on background about people I know who are actually preppers and gave a bunch of colorful (and cringey) quotes, which is an unfortunate habit I have.

This gets redundant after a while, but the point is that this viewpoint has been noted by no shortage of news outlets both large and small. It is also a complete about-face from [spez's own original position 9 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/)

> ? This isn't any change in policy: we've always banned hate speech, and we always will. It's not up for debate.

> You can bitch and moan all you like, but me and my team aren't going to be responsible for encouraging behaviors that lead to hate.

However, it is more consistent with his recent views such as ["...the last thing we're going to do is take their voice away."](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx/)

At one point in time, reddit played host to [one of the internet's largest known collection of hate-specific forums online.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversial_Reddit_communities&oldid=836344847#The_"Chimpire") Over the years, one or two related subreddits would be banned at a time, but it wasn't until August 2015's banning of CT that the entire network of participating subreddits was effectively banned.

With the present observed shift in ideals by Reddit and its present leadership, assuming that it still existed today, would CT be banned?

<u/spez>: Yes. Since we banned CT in 2015, we‚Äôve updated our policies against harassment, bullying, and violence, all of which would be grounds for dismissal for that community.

Furthermore, the teams who make and enforce these decisions are much more robust. 

CT was frustrating as the time because we didn‚Äôt have the policies and processes in place, but they wouldn‚Äôt last long today.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit‚Äôs latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team‚Äôs efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don‚Äôt consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You‚Äôll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I‚Äôd also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I‚Äôve mentioned before that we‚Äôre cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we‚Äôre going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I‚Äôd like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation‚Äîall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It‚Äôs also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I‚Äôll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

update: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions!

<u/aznanimality>: >In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin.  
  
  
Any info on what subs they were posting to?

<u/spez>: There were about 14k posts in total by all of these users. The top ten communities by posts were:

* funny: 1455
* uncen: 1443
* Bad_Cop_No_Donut: 800
* gifs: 553
* PoliticalHumor: 545
* The_Donald: 316
* news: 306
* aww: 290
* POLITIC: 232
* racism: 214

We left the accounts up so you may dig in yourselves.

<u/RamsesThePigeon>: Speaking as a moderator of both /r/Funny and /r/GIFs, I'd like to offer a bit of clarification here.

When illicit accounts are created, they usually go through a period of posting low-effort content that's intended to quickly garner a lot of karma. These accounts generally aren't registered by the people who wind up using them for propaganda purposes, though. In fact, they're often "farmed" by call-center-like environments overseas ‚Äì popular locations are India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, and Russia ‚Äì then sold to firms that specialize in spinning information (whether for advertising, pushing political agendas, or anything else).

If you're interested, [this brief guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/3jss04/meta_spammers_how_they_work_and_how_to_spot_them/) can give you a primer on how to spot spammers.

Now, the reason I bring this up is because for every shill account that actually takes off, there are quite literally a hundred more that get stopped in their tracks. A banned account is of very little use to the people who would employ it for nefarious purposes... but the simple truth of the matter is that moderators still need to rely on their subscribers for help. If you see a repost, a low-effort (or poorly written) comment, or something else that just doesn't sit right with you, it's often a good idea to look at the user who submitted it. A surprising amount of the time, you'll discover that the submitter is a karma-farmer; a spammer or a propagandist in the making.

When you spot one, please report it to the moderators of that subReddit.

Reddit has gotten a lot better at cracking down on these accounts behind the scenes, but there's still a long way to go... and as users, every one of us can make a difference, even if it sometimes doesn't seem like it.

<u/spez>: It's not clear from the banned users pages, but mods banned more than half of the users and a majority of the posts before they got any traction at all. That was heartening to see. Thank you for all that you and your mod cabal do for Reddit. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation‚Äîall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It‚Äôs also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/).

<u/nhiZIM>: You guys are seriously doing an amazing job, thank you for your work and transparency. 

<u/spez>: Haven't heard that in a while. Thank you. The haters must be hating elsewhere today. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit‚Äôs latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team‚Äôs efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don‚Äôt consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You‚Äôll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I‚Äôd also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I‚Äôve mentioned before that we‚Äôre cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we‚Äôre going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I‚Äôd like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don‚Äôt consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You‚Äôll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I‚Äôd also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I‚Äôve mentioned before that we‚Äôre cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we‚Äôre going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I‚Äôd like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation‚Äîall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It‚Äôs also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I‚Äôll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

update: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions!

<u/nacho_grande>: Thanks for being more transparent then facebook has been with tracking down accounts linked back the IRA. 

Facebook mentioned today that there may be 10's of thousands of accounts that may be bots/actors on their platform. Do you think that there could be more bots/actors on the reddit platform? How do you go about tracking that?

Also, when is reddit going to be reviewing /r/the_donald for rules that they are obviously breaking? I'm not saying to ban the sub, but to enforce rules for the accounts breaking reddit site rules.

Edit: RIP MY INBOX

<u/spez>: The accounts we released today are the ones we confirmed as suspicious, but we continue to look for more.

We review r/the_donald frequently. We don't believe they are presently breaking our [site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/). That does not mean we endorse their views, however. In many cases their views and values conflict with my own, but allowing other views to exist is what lends authenticity to all of Reddit.

I understand many of you do not agree with me, but I believe it's critical that we are disciplined when enforcing our content policies.

<u/chlomyster>: I need clarification on something: Is obvious open racism, including slurs, against reddits rules or not?

<u/spez>: **Update (4/12):** In the heat of a live AMA, I don‚Äôt always find the right words to express what I mean.  I decided to answer this direct question knowing it would be a difficult one because it comes up on Reddit quite a bit. I‚Äôd like to add more nuance to my answer:

While the words and expressions you refer to aren‚Äôt explicitly forbidden, the behaviors they often lead to are. 

To be perfectly clear, while racism itself isn‚Äôt against the rules, it‚Äôs not welcome here. I try to stay neutral on most political topics, but this isn‚Äôt one of them.

I believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.

When it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control people‚Äôs beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.

There exist repugnant views in the world. As a result, these views may also exist on Reddit. I don‚Äôt want them to exist on Reddit any more than I want them to exist in the world, but I believe that presenting a sanitized view of humanity does us all a disservice. It‚Äôs up to all of us to reject these views.

These are complicated issues, and we may not always agree, but I am listening to your responses, and I do appreciate your perspectives. Our policies have changed a lot over the years, and will continue to evolve into the future. Thank you.

**Original response:**

It's not. On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs. This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.

Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

<u/gihorn13>: And yet I doubt any of these accounts betrayed others' circles - a valuable lesson in who we can truly trust.

<u/spez>: I often talk about how Reddit has taught me that when put in the right context, people are more funny, interesting, collaborative, and helpful than we give them credit for. Look at all the wonderful things people do for one another through Reddit.

CircleOfTrust taught me that I was wrong. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

<u/LeVentNoir>: It's actually really honest and open of administration to be posting such detailed information about state propoganda actors.

The very interesting part is how only 7% had more than 1,000 karma, a relatively trivial amount for a real person to access.

Of course, the actions of those accounts are the same kind of low grade pot stirring expected, but with large enough, and echoy enough pots, stirring them only makes the nutty clumps hold together more.

update: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions!

<u/thataustinbloke>: 944 accounts is all you were able to come up with?  That number seems insanely low to me.

Edit: Aside from the obvious it seems low to me because [reddit is the 6th most visited site in the world and has by far the most time spent on site](https://www.alexa.com/topsites).  Users spend almost 30% more time on Reddit than Facebook.  That‚Äôs a lot of time to spend reading divisive material.  Reddit is a prime target for organizations wanting to spread division and if Facebook and Twitter have millions of these accounts then Reddit certainly has more than 944.

<u/spez>: You are more than welcome to bring suspicious accounts to my attention directly, or report them to r/reddit.com.

We do ask that you do not post them publicly: we have seen public false positives lead to harassment. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit‚Äôs latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team‚Äôs efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don‚Äôt consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You‚Äôll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I‚Äôd also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I‚Äôve mentioned before that we‚Äôre cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we‚Äôre going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I‚Äôd like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation‚Äîall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It‚Äôs also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I‚Äôll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

update: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions!

<u/youareadildomadam>: There's recently been a LARGE increase in the number of pro-Russian, pro-Assad posts & comments in /r/syriancivilwar.  

Maybe that's normal or maybe not.  How can **YOU** tell if they are actually Russian agents trying to sway western public opinion?

...I suppose the same is true about all the pro-China green posts that seem to spam certain subs. ...or the pro-Saudi reform posts that seem to oddly make the front page. 

There's not way for *us* to know if they are posted from China - but can *you* tell?  ...or are you in the dark like the rest of us?

EDIT:  /u/spez, you should go into politics, because you did not answer the fucking question.

<u/spez>: That community is on our radar for a variety of reasons, and we're investigating. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

<u/jumja>: Hey /u/spez, on a scale of 1 to 944, how happy are you to not be Mark Zuckerberg today?

A more serious note, thank you for your openness in this. It was already much appreciated in earlier years, but the current events really reminded me how amazing it really is that you‚Äôre doing this. 

Edit: whooaah gold?! Within a minute!? Thanks totally completely anonymous giver! 

Edit: triple gold?! Y‚Äôall are crazy and I love you. Have an amazing day. 

<u/spez>: 943: Save 1 point for my mother, who I think would enjoy watching.

In all seriousness, we feel somewhat vindicated.

update: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions!

<u/nacho_grande>: Thanks for being more transparent then facebook has been with tracking down accounts linked back the IRA. 

Facebook mentioned today that there may be 10's of thousands of accounts that may be bots/actors on their platform. Do you think that there could be more bots/actors on the reddit platform? How do you go about tracking that?

Also, when is reddit going to be reviewing /r/the_donald for rules that they are obviously breaking? I'm not saying to ban the sub, but to enforce rules for the accounts breaking reddit site rules.

Edit: RIP MY INBOX

<u/spez>: The accounts we released today are the ones we confirmed as suspicious, but we continue to look for more.

We review r/the_donald frequently. We don't believe they are presently breaking our [site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/). That does not mean we endorse their views, however. In many cases their views and values conflict with my own, but allowing other views to exist is what lends authenticity to all of Reddit.

I understand many of you do not agree with me, but I believe it's critical that we are disciplined when enforcing our content policies. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

<u/FreedomDatAss>: It seems like ads targeting people do just as much harm as posts triggering people.  

Have you (as Reddit) seen or been monitoring ad purchases originating outside the US?  Aka Russia purchasing ad space to push their own messages/etc.   

Also, if its possible to label the ads and who they were purchased by?  Similar to the UK law recently pushed that discloses the identities of groups that purchased the ads.  [Source](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-facebook-privacy/facebook-backs-political-ad-bill-sets-limits-on-issue-ads-idUKKCN1HD2JD)



<u/spez>: We didn't see any political ads from Russia during the election. Nevertheless, we no longer accept advertising from Russia at all.

With regard to ads transparency, I think we can do more here, yes. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You‚Äôll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I‚Äôd also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I‚Äôve mentioned before that we‚Äôre cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we‚Äôre going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I‚Äôd like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation‚Äîall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It‚Äôs also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I‚Äôll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

<u/JDGumby>: > efforts to protect user privacy.

Yeah, you don't give the slightest shit about user privacy - the vastly increased tracking on the site shows that.  Can't even right-click to copy a link (to share or to open in a browser that renders it differently), or to bookmark it or whatever, without it being tracked now (and showing up in the recently-viewed liinks list), as the most recent example.

<u/spez>: On the contrary, user privacy has been paramount since our founding. From the beginning and through to this day we've not collected PII (Personally Identifying Information). We don't know your name, address, age, race, gender, and we don't want to know, and we'll never force you to share it to use Reddit. We only store the IP addresses you use to access Reddit for 100 days.

We do this for a couple of reasons:

* We don't want the burden of storing this information
* We don't want to risk compromising it
* What makes Reddit special is that people can be themselves. We believe disconnecting from your real world identity makes this possible.
* We want to minimize the surface area against which we can be subpoenaed

We haven't made any significant changes to our tracking in the last year beyond updating our endpoints to avoid site-breaking changes by ad-blockers (though not to block ad-blockers themselves).

We do track your clicks. We do this so we can better rank which subreddits you see in your home feed. You can opt out at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/. Furthermore, you can opt out of other advertising related tracking at https://www.reddit.com/personalization/. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit‚Äôs 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings

In our previous four redesign blog posts, [u/Amg137](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amg137) and [u/hueylewisandthesnoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/hueylewisandthesnoos) talked about[ why we're redesigning](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign),[ moderation in the redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded),[ our approach to design](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team), and[ Reddit‚Äôs evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit). Today, Reddit‚Äôs Engineering team invites you ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù look at how we‚Äôre giving a long overdue update to Reddit‚Äôs core stack.

Spoiler: There‚Äôs going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we‚Äôll get through it together.

**History and Journey**

For most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit‚Äôs engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days‚Äîa [complete rewrite](https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/) from Lisp to Python in 2006, then *another* Python rewrite \(aka ‚Äúr2‚Äù\) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/user/spez) wrote about ten years ago.

Given Reddit‚Äôs historically tiny eng team \(at one point it was literally just [u/spladug](/user/spladug)\), our code wasn‚Äôt always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:

* [u/spladug](https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug): "For a while now, ‚ÄòThe controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist‚Äô has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.‚Äù
* [u/KeyserSosa](https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa): "After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that \(unsurprisingly\) part of the code review process is to use ‚Äògit blame‚Äô to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file \(one of the more core JS files we had\). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being ‚Äòfull stack‚Äô to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised \(and depressed\) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee \(a senior web dev\) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing."
* [u/ketralnis](http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis): ‚ÄúI worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.‚Äù

Luckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown *a lot* since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team‚Äôs current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you‚Äôve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements \(like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons\), and new features \(like inline images in text posts and submit validation\). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.

Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit‚Äôs desktop code to date.

**Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags**

Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages \(Javascript on the client and Python on the server\). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn‚Äôt want to outright break.

When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble‚Äîwith a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit‚Äôs 330 million monthly users.

But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase "developer velocity," or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more "git blame" for decade\-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.

**The New Tech Stack**

These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:

* React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components\-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.
* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.
* TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type\-related bugs, has good built\-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. \(You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in [this post](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/) by [u/nr4madas.\)](http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas)

**Just the Beginning**

With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We‚Äôve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we‚Äôve gotten from a steadily growing number of users \(well, [a *mostly* steady number...](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/)\). So far, we‚Äôve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of \~20 features and 200\+ bugs per month.

We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items \(like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts\), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign‚Äîand because of our engineers‚Äô work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.

Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish‚Äîwe do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to use it.

[Thank you](https://media3.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif) to everyone who‚Äôs helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.

(And, Hi! It was a pleasure getting to know you and your team. I‚Äôm still working up the courage the read the piece myself.) <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I‚Äôd like to share our thinking.

In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it‚Äôs an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, we‚Äôd like to share some of what we‚Äôve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don‚Äôt see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015‚Äì2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOP‚Äôs Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it‚Äôs not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It‚Äôs up to all of us‚ÄîRedditors, citizens, journalists‚Äîto work through these issues. It‚Äôs somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we‚Äôre going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

Thank you for reading. While I know it‚Äôs frustrating that we don‚Äôt share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve.

<u/megustalogin>: A lot of words were used, but very little was said. Most of this has been said and discussed in many a thread before. This post is completely reactionary due to recent articles in the news. This type of post is better for your media relations, not the users. You've told us nothing about the current atmosphere. Why you will ban certain havens, but not others. This post is anything but transparent. It's basically 'yeah, yeah, shit's happening, please don't leave us because we're not doing anything about it'. 

<u/spez>: This post is really the first time we've said anything of consequence regarding Russia, and we wanted to share it with you, the community, first.

> A lot of words were used, but very little was said.

Let me try again, with at least fewer words, but hopefully a little more clearly as well.

1. In regards to ads, we haven't seen much on Reddit. It's been an issue elsewhere online, but not a factor on Reddit. We'll stay vigilant going forward.

2. As it relates to actual Russia accounts on Reddit. We have found a few hundred accounts through a variety of means. The vast majority of these accounts were rejected by our communities back in 2015‚Äì2016 before Russia was even a topic of conversation. Our spam filters, community rules against self-promotion, and moderators banned nearly all of them. I don't want to give the impression the work stops there. That's what we've seen so far, and we're still looking deeply.

3. As for propaganda (Russian or otherwise, and there was plenty of American propaganda to go around) hosted elsewhere that was amplified by real organic users, we‚Äôve seen a lot of that, both on Reddit and elsewhere. Reddit is a huge place with thousands of communities and opinions. That's both what makes us special and what creates conflict. That's not to say there isn't plenty of work for us: we will continue to invest in better tooling, both for our internal teams and for moderators; we'll continue to ensure our voting systems aren't being manipulated; and we'll continue grow our teams so we can enforce our policies at scale.

<u/FitTension>: > all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans

This is just a blatant lie. You use programmatic ads both on the website and in your mobile apps. Users are constantly making posts about ads that shouldn't have been shown - gigantic ads, ones with autoplaying video/sound, even malware and redirects sometimes.

The admins that reply to these posts make it clear that they don't even know what ads are running, and need the user to capture data about the ad for them to be able to do anything about the bad ones.

<u/spez>: Point taken. Didn't mean to mislead. I was referring to ads bought directly on Reddit either through our sales team or ads.reddit.com.

We do also run programmatic ads that are bought through ad networks that include Reddit. These don't go through the same approval process, but they're also not specific to Reddit. We have had occasional problems in the past where an ad with sound or video sneaks through, usually when an ad is misclassified as non-video. These issues are uncommon, and we've basically eliminated them in the last year.

<u/RealChris_is_crazy>: Didn't mean to mislead? Sure, I guess I can understand that, but really? "Uncommon"? Honestly, these ads are the reason I, and most likely many others, use adblockers. I really would not mind letting ads through on Reddit, but most of these are so toxic and annoying that I get fed up with them. Do you have any plans to monitor and watch programmatic ads? I understand that most all of Reddit revenue comes from advertisements, and I believe that more people would be inclined to disable their adblocking programs if they felt that they wouldn't be assaulted by nonsense.

Edit: I know this comment could of come across as angry, but I'm really not. I am just trying to be frank and speak for what I think (most) redditors feel. If you feel otherwise, please provide your input. The larger the image I can gather, the better.

<u/spez>: I'm sorry that's your experience. That's certainly not our intention. The ads are monitored, and if you're having a different experience, please report them to me. 

Update: I can't speak for third-party apps who run their own ads, which I think is relevant to you. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I‚Äôd like to share our thinking.

Example of the garbage [NSFL/Death warning]

https://np.reddit.com/r/nomorals/comments/81vbeh/this_is_what_evolution_looks_like/

Context: A guy is being burned death, inside a tire on a road and people surrounding him adding more fuel to it. 

He already had lots of injuries and there is some blood splatter, in all likelihood it's mob justice.

It's titled: "This is what evolution looks like"

Another example:

A dog and few puppies being hanged from their neck, its titled - "Multipurpose Wind Chime"

https://np.reddit.com/r/nomorals/comments/7t3msf/multipurpose_wind_chime/

<u/spez>: We are aware, and this community is under review.

More context: the original creator of the sub nuked it about two months ago and deleted all the content. It‚Äôs now back up and running, which is why we‚Äôre getting new reports.

<u/lpisme>: "We are aware" 

OK, wonderful and I mean that. You have been "aware" of a myriad of subreddits that you rightfully nixed, from gore to near child porn. What kind of internal review process do you have for subreddits and what actually - and finally - gets stuff dropped? 

You are making a really great attempt at transparency to the extent you can with this post and it's appreciated...so can you share a little bit about what actually gets a subreddit canned or not? Because this is a constant question and it has always, at least from my understanding, been so damn grey and ambiguous. 


<u/spez>: We don‚Äôt take banning subs lightly. Each sub is reviewed by a human‚Äîand in some cases, a team of humans‚Äîbefore it is banned for a content policy violation. In cases where a sub‚Äôs sole purpose is in direct violation of our policies (i.e. sharing of involuntary porn), we will ban a sub outright. But generally before banning, we attempt to work with the mods to clarify our expectations and policies regarding what content is welcome.

Communities do evolve over time, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively, so we do need to re-review communities from time to time, which is what's going on in this case. Revenue isn't a factor. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I‚Äôd like to share our thinking.

In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it‚Äôs an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, we‚Äôd like to share some of what we‚Äôve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don‚Äôt see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015‚Äì2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOP‚Äôs Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it‚Äôs not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It‚Äôs up to all of us‚ÄîRedditors, citizens, journalists‚Äîto work through these issues. It‚Äôs somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we‚Äôre going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

<u/kerovon>: So I see you are carrying on the Reddit Tradition of only taking action after the media notices a problem.  Is there any chance this will change in the future?

Here is a comment from [3 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2fpdax/time_to_talk/ckbga2v/) outlining this exact problem. Nothing seems to have changed.

Some advice about something you could do:  Seeing as the russian propaganda has been actively promoting white suprmacism and extremist ethnostatist neo nationalists, maybe you could look at removing all of the openly nazi subreddits that seem to get ignored by the admins?  If you don't give the russians a gaping, festering wound that they can stick their fingers in to enlarge, it will be harder for them to do anything.

It should be added that there has been a [study that shows banning shithole subs works](https://gizmodo.com/study-finds-banning-reddits-bigoted-jerkwards-worked-1803766754).

Edit: if you are tired of looking at the various shitholes being cited in all of these comment threads, I recommend checking out /r/316cats, one of the few actually good subreddits.

<u/spez>: > So I see you are carrying on the Reddit Tradition of only taking action after the media notices a problem. Is there any chance this will change in the future?

As I mentioned in the post, we've been taking action for a long time. We have been cagey about it publicly I know, which frustrates us as well, but it's an active investigation, and it's difficult to share specifics without undermining it.

I know this isn't a satisfying answer, but I promise you this is something we are deeply focused on.

<u/dank2918>: How can we as a community more effectively identify and remove the propaganda when it is reposted by Americans? How can we increase awareness and more effectively watch for it? 

<u/spez>: These are the important questions we should be asking, both on Reddit and more broadly in America.

On Reddit, we see our users and communities taking action, whether it's moderators banning domains or users downvoting posts and comments. During the same time periods mentioned in this [Buzzfeed analysis](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook), engagement of biased news sources on Reddit dropped 58% and engagement of fake news sources (as defined at the domain level by Buzzfeed) dropped 56%. Trustworthy new sources on Reddit receive 5x the engagement of biased sources and 100x the engagement of fake news sources.

The biggest factor in fighting back is awareness, and one of the silver linings of this ordeal is that awareness is higher than ever.

We still have a long way to go, but I believe we are making progress. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I‚Äôd like to share our thinking.

<u/lawvas>: Why aren't you doing more to stop reddit from being used as a platform to advocate violence?  People are being radicalized and then acting on that radicalization.  Just ban the subs and the users that permit such tactics.  Don't let the users or the mods of the subs with those users get away with it.

So when the FCC repealed net neutrality rules, I decided to see if there was anything states could do to ensure a free and open internet for everyone. Turns out there is ‚Äì and I became the first governor in the country to sign an Executive Order protecting net neutrality: https://twitter.com/GovernorBullock/status/955509233293733888

Hello again,

Now that it‚Äôs far enough into the year that we‚Äôre all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I‚Äôd give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we‚Äôre working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven‚Äôt tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we‚Äôre especially pleased to see features that didn‚Äôt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we‚Äôre still working on these features and we‚Äôll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you‚Äôd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I‚Äôm particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We‚Äôve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we‚Äôre catching issues before they become issues. I‚Äôd like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I‚Äôve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I‚Äôm serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we‚Äôll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It‚Äôs still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you‚Äôd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We‚Äôll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We‚Äôre super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.

We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we‚Äôre still working on these features and we‚Äôll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you‚Äôd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I‚Äôm particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We‚Äôve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we‚Äôre catching issues before they become issues. I‚Äôd like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I‚Äôve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I‚Äôm serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we‚Äôll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It‚Äôs still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you‚Äôd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We‚Äôll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We‚Äôre super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

This is a lot of words, but I don't know what they mean.  Are you talking about spam, brigades, doxxing, bots, or what?

<u/spez>: All of those things, yes, with a particular focus on PM harassment last year. This year our focus will be reducing the amount of noise in our reporting system so that the reports moderators and we see will be much more useful.

<u/shiruken>: If more stuff is being automated, then why is the response time from /r/reddit.com still so slow?

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: The goal for ticket response time is 24h, which is reasonable given the load. We maintained that for most of the year, but slipped in Q4 to a median response time of 35h because we've spent more time on proactive support to prevent major issues. We're reorganizing the team to have folks dedicated full time to support tickets and hiring more to stay on top of our numbers.

I'm sorry we slipped, but please don't assume it's because we don't care. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

Used to be I requested desktop once on a new device and I was good to go. Now I get an ad and a mobile layout every time I load the front page. 

Why do tech companies have to fix what isn‚Äôt broken?

<u/spez>: We can't fix things if we don't break them first!

But seriously, I know it's annoying. We're going to redo all that.

<u/wantagh>: Look, I don‚Äôt like r/pics either, but I‚Äôve come to accept them. 

<u/spez>: Generally the mods of pics have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of pics that refuse to work with us.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population needs random pictures about nothing.

We are on the eve of the President‚Äôs SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we‚Äôre more divided than ever. I don‚Äôt believe banning a community that represents no viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. It‚Äôs much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

<u/[deleted]>: Why isn't 

The_donald 

And all affiliated subs banned for breaking almost every site-wide rule you have yet?


edit:  Read this comment by /u/illpaco

> Here is a very complete list of violations by the_donald of Reddit's policy. This was sent directly to to u/spez a while ago.

> https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa

> This is not about censoring people with opposing views. Don't buy into that false narrative. This is about applying the rules equally across the board. For whatever reason, the_donald is treated with a different standard than other subs and people are fully aware of it. The only ones turning a blind eye to these blatant violations are the admins themselves.

<u/spez>: Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population felt left out, left behind, and unheard by the system.

We are on the eve of the President‚Äôs SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we‚Äôre more divided than ever. I don‚Äôt believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. It‚Äôs much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs.

<u/PapaSmurfOrochi>: So with Facebook and Google stepping up it's anti-bot defense, do you see Reddit going in that same direction? Or are we going to just keep ignoring the elephant in the room?

If people are able to manipulate the top stories by paying for Fake accounts that spam/upvote, what's next?



<u/spez>: Reddit is more communal and has more shared spaces than our peers, which means both that Reddit is better insulated from these sorts of attacks (moderators, downvotes, community acceptance), and it also means we've felt it our duty from the beginning to protect our communities from this sort of abuse.

Cheaters do succeed from time to time, but we take this sort abuse extremely seriously, and are constantly getting better at fighting it. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

In fact, one of the lessons I‚Äôve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I‚Äôm serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we‚Äôll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It‚Äôs still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you‚Äôd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We‚Äôll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We‚Äôre super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.

<u/-eDgAR->: Will mods ever be getting tools to help combat the surge of sockpuppet accounts that appear on the site daily? Also what happened to antibrigading tools that were talked about a long time ago?

<u/spez>: Moderators shouldn't have to deal with sockpuppets and brigading, but we do take abuse of Reddit seriously, and spend a fair amount of time working on it. Our VP Product gave a [long answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/7sn6b0/regarding_crossposts/dt6bhm9/?context=0) on this topic earlier this week.

The tl;dr is we're adopting more sophisticated approaches to brigading and manipulation.



<u/AnArcher>: But what if mods **want** to combat the surge of sockpuppet accounts? Shouldn't they have the means?

<u/spez>: We'd really like to, tbh, but there are major privacy concerns with exposing that sort of information. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

Hello again,

Now that it‚Äôs far enough into the year that we‚Äôre all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I‚Äôd give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we‚Äôre working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven‚Äôt tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we‚Äôre especially pleased to see features that didn‚Äôt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we‚Äôre still working on these features and we‚Äôll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you‚Äôd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I‚Äôm particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We‚Äôve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we‚Äôre catching issues before they become issues. I‚Äôd like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

<u/BishamonX>: The only request I want to make is to please add a dark mode into the new upcoming layout natively without needing RES or any addon. Love dark mode on the app, would love to have it on desktop as well.

If you do it, I'll totally add a trophy to your profile. I don't know how, but I will think of something.

Other than that, keep up the great work.

In 2018, we‚Äôll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It‚Äôs still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you‚Äôd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta.

We‚Äôre super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Hello again,

Now that it‚Äôs far enough into the year that we‚Äôre all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I‚Äôd give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we‚Äôre working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven‚Äôt tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we‚Äôre especially pleased to see features that didn‚Äôt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we‚Äôre still working on these features and we‚Äôll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you‚Äôd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I‚Äôm particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We‚Äôve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we‚Äôre catching issues before they become issues. I‚Äôd like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I‚Äôve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I‚Äôm serious!\).

This is a lot of words, but I don't know what they mean.  Are you talking about spam, brigades, doxxing, bots, or what?

<u/spez>: All of those things, yes, with a particular focus on PM harassment last year.

<u/Iamthenewme>: Thanks for the hard work you all put in to keep this place going. 

I like that reddit has steadily been recovering towards being more honest and personal in communicating things, and us old users are especially thankful for keeping the censorship to a smaller degree than the loud voices ask for.

 You take a lot of flak either way, but I really hope that this place will remain aligned towards free expression  even if it can't afford to be "a bastion of free speech" anymore .


<u/spez>: Thank you. We know we have a long way to go, but I'm proud of how far we and the team have come.

Taking flak is part of the gig. Doesn't always feel good, but the passion of our users in every direction is what makes this place special. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

<u/-eDgAR->: Will mods ever be getting tools to help combat the surge of sockpuppet accounts that appear on the site daily? Also what happened to antibrigading tools that were talked about a long time ago?

<u/spez>: Moderators shouldn't have to deal with sockpuppets and brigading, but we do take abuse of Reddit seriously, and spend a fair amount of time working on it. Our VP Product gave a [long answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/7sn6b0/regarding_crossposts/dt6bhm9/?context=0) on this topic earlier this week.

The tl;dr is we're adopting more sophisticated approaches to brigading and manipulation.

Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we‚Äôll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It‚Äôs still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you‚Äôd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We‚Äôll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We‚Äôre super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.

<u/etr4807>: You mention the web redesign as being the biggest project in 2018. As I'm sure you're aware, almost every site that goes through any kind of redesign also goes through a long period of everyone complaining that they just want the old site back.

My question would be what plans do you have in place to ensure that the redesign is something that the overwhelming majority of users are actually satisfied with?

<u/spez>: We've been in testing the past few months with a few thousand users and moderators, and the feedback has been super valuable. Every week we survey the testers and invite more users. We'll expanding the beta to many more users over the next month. Subscribe to r/beta to get involved.

As I mentioned in my post, in addition to bringing in more users to test, we'll be doing a series of blog posts and videos to explain what we're doing and what we're trying to accomplish.

Speaking as a Reddit user, I've been using the new site nearly exclusively the past couple of weeks, and am pretty happy. We're not there yet, but Reddit is as addictive as ever. I even had to re-block it on the my laptop during working hours. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

Hello again,

Now that it‚Äôs far enough into the year that we‚Äôre all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I‚Äôd give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we‚Äôre working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven‚Äôt tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we‚Äôre especially pleased to see features that didn‚Äôt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we‚Äôre still working on these features and we‚Äôll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you‚Äôd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I‚Äôm particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We‚Äôve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we‚Äôre catching issues before they become issues. I‚Äôd like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

<u/RetroSplicer>: I just want the option of seeing only legacy profiles. The new ones are so clunky and ugly. 

<u/spez>: Yes, we're adding an option for the legacy profiles while we finish the new ones.

The team is all hands on deck finishing the redesign, which means we've slowed on the new profiles. Our plan is to pause the rollout, give an option to use the legacy version, and finish the profiles with the redesign, taking into account the feedback we've received so far.



<u/shhhhquiet>: > while we finish the new ones.

Only while you finish?  Will this option go away when you're satisfied with the new ones?  

<u/spez>: Here's how I see things going: we'll do our very best to get the redesign out. This is a massive effort, involves much of our team, and thousands of user testers (increasing to hundreds of thousands over the next month). The redesign will include another pass at profile pages. We don't have plans to shut off the legacy site, though it may run under a different domain. We'll leave old profile pages there.

Most of the feedback we've received on the new profiles are very addressable, so I'm confident we'll get it to a place most users like, but we'll have the old site just in case.

update: No this wasn't the plan from the beginning, but we also didn't plan on diverting resources to finish up the redesign. We still have a vision for profiles that we believe we be really good for the site, but we're not there yet. We hear your frustration, and will do our best to work out of the situation. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

<u/GaBeRockKing>: Just a bit of feedback: the new user profile pages are hard to CTRL+F through for specific comments or posts. Perhaps there could be some sort of toggle on the viewer's side to not view the context of each comment, even without changing the rest of the page's appearance.

(I know devs hate undoing work they did, so this could work as a compromise between the new version and completely reverting to the old version.)

<u/[deleted]>: Why isn't 

The_donald 

And all affiliated subs banned for breaking almost every site-wide rule you have yet?


edit:  Read this comment by /u/illpaco

> Here is a very complete list of violations by the_donald of Reddit's policy. This was sent directly to to u/spez a while ago.

> https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp6youa

> This is not about censoring people with opposing views. Don't buy into that false narrative. This is about applying the rules equally across the board. For whatever reason, the_donald is treated with a different standard than other subs and people are fully aware of it. The only ones turning a blind eye to these blatant violations are the admins themselves.

<u/spez>: Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population felt left out, left behind, and unheard by the system.

We are on the eve of the President‚Äôs SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and we‚Äôre more divided than ever. I don‚Äôt believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. It‚Äôs much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Not my first, could be my last, State of the Snoo-nion

Now that it‚Äôs far enough into the year that we‚Äôre all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought I‚Äôd give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what we‚Äôre working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you haven‚Äôt tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we‚Äôre especially pleased to see features that didn‚Äôt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but we‚Äôre still working on these features and we‚Äôll do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If you‚Äôd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

I‚Äôm particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. We‚Äôve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we‚Äôre catching issues before they become issues. I‚Äôd like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I‚Äôve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I‚Äôm serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we‚Äôll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It‚Äôs still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we‚Äôre excited about the progress we‚Äôve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you‚Äôd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We‚Äôll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We‚Äôre super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions.

<u/AdjectiveNounCombo>: Truly I don't know what's more amazing- how far Reddit has come in the past year, or the fact that we still don't have a decent search function.

<u/spez>: We still have a long way to go, but we [are making progress] (https://redditblog.com/2017/09/07/the-search-for-better-search-at-reddit/) on search. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/RoastMe>: 20 and dying of cancer at the reddit HQ, had lunch with Spez, please tear me a new one!

<u/dillwillhill>: I'm sure /u/spez has some nice things to say about Chris

<u/spez>: Nope.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: The FCC‚Äôs vote was predictably frustrating, but we‚Äôre not done fighting for net neutrality.

Following today‚Äôs disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that we‚Äôre going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users‚Äô everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC‚Äôs own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today‚Äôs vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don‚Äôt exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC‚Äôs decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It‚Äôs also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren‚Äôt subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn‚Äôt the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you‚Äôve created. Those who thought that they‚Äôd be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We‚Äôll keep you informed as things develop.

u\/arabscarab \(Jessica, our head of policy\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. 

‚Äîu\/spez & u\/kn0thing

update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).

update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 3‚Äì2.

<u/baltinerdist>: u/spez, u/arabscarab, u/kn0thing:

If a Comcast or Verizon or whoever approaches reddit and says they're basically putting together a "Social Media Elite Pro MegaAccess" package that gives you a different level of access (non-throttled or maybe even priority traffic) to your website, are you willing to sign that deal?

The users are going to get the short end of this stick but the long end still reaches out to the sites that are cordoned off by un-neutral net.

<u/spez>: No. We don‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: The FCC‚Äôs vote was predictably frustrating, but we‚Äôre not done fighting for net neutrality.

***Edit*** addressing some concerns below

Hello, this is the owner of MailMyGov. First of all thanks to u/spez ... the bot is positively beaming :) I think it deserves the weekend off.


Also wanted to address a couple of the comments. Yes places like battleforthenet.com are awesome and amazing and you should use them. So are all the other links in the bot post.
But afaik, they don't let you send a real letter. Our letters are printed out and mailed in house (a deliberate decision for security and privacy) in NYC. Every letter is double-checked to be sure everything is printed, enveloped, stamped and sealed properly. A real human does all of this, and a real human goes to the post office every morning and drops them off. All of this does mean that it's a bit more expensive to get this all done, not to mention payment processing fees, api usage costs, server costs and the overhead. 


Hope this helps, and regardless, the everyone should try their best to organize, inform, advocate and VOTE and we hope MailMyGov can help in some of that.


Cheers! (any feedback is always welcome)

	 
	 


<u/spez>: good bot <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/blog>: An update on the fight for the free and open internet

**Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!

Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what‚Äôs happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You‚Äôve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday‚Äôs news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCC‚Äôs vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality‚Äôs giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don‚Äôt see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don‚Äôt introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC‚Äôs decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel‚Äôs suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to ‚Äúmake a ruckus‚Äù to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we‚Äôre asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to ‚Äî if it comes to it ‚Äî the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

u/ArabScarab \(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\), and I will hang around to answer questions.

<u/festivemanb>: I'd like Reddit to go dark for a day to protest.

<u/spez>: We've considered that but decided ultimately decided against it. People depend on Reddit, and we felt it would be irresponsible to take it offline, even for a protest as important is this one.

Additionally, the community takeover on Thanksgiving was likely more effective than a blackout. It drove a ton of traffic, started many conversations, and picked up lots of press, all of which would be the goal of a blackout.

<u/Chel_of_the_sea>: > People depend on Reddit, and we felt it would be irresponsible to take it offline, even for a protest as important is this one.

Then put up a big, impossible to miss splash page. Let people get to vital information if need be, but if this passes, you're going to be denying a lot more people that access anyway.

<u/spez>: We did exactly that back in July when the FCC requested comments.

<u/baldr83>: Can you do it again? Or at least a bar at the top of every page?

<u/spez>: ~~Not strictly opposed to it, but I do want to make sure we are spending our and your energy where it will be most effective. I don't think we can affect the FCC's vote in Dec because it's clear they're disregarding the views of the public.~~

Depending on what happens afterwards, whether it's a court challenge or legislation, we'll coordinate our next moves with the community.

update: Actually, we're going to put something up. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/blog>: An update on the fight for the free and open internet

**Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!

Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what‚Äôs happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You‚Äôve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday‚Äôs news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCC‚Äôs vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality‚Äôs giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don‚Äôt see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don‚Äôt introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC‚Äôs decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel‚Äôs suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to ‚Äúmake a ruckus‚Äù to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we‚Äôre asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to ‚Äî if it comes to it ‚Äî the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

u/ArabScarab \(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\), and I will hang around to answer questions.

<u/festivemanb>: I'd like Reddit to go dark for a day to protest.

<u/spez>: We've considered that but decided ultimately decided against it. People depend on Reddit, and we felt it would be irresponsible to take it offline, even for a protest as important is this one.

Additionally, the community takeover on Thanksgiving was likely more effective than a blackout.

<u/Jakeable>: What's the expected monetary cost to reddit if a policy like this is put into place?

<u/spez>: It's hard to say exactly, and that's part of the problem.

Most Americans have little or no choice of ISPs, and as it happens, the largest ISPs in the US are also some of the largest media companies.

For consumers, this means the ISP you are practically forced to use also can control what media you have access to.

For business, this means you are at the mercy of the ISPs, who as media companies are also likely competitors, to reach your customer. Bandwidth intensive, yet worldly important companies like Netflix and YouTube would have a really hard time getting off the ground if they existed at the whims of the major ISPs/media companies. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition.

Hello Everyone!

It‚Äôs been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I‚Äôd check in and share a few updates.

It‚Äôs been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit‚Äôs web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we‚Äôll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We‚Äôve got a long way to go, but the feedback we‚Äôve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you‚Äôd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We‚Äôve made many other changes as well, and if you‚Äôre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go‚Ä¶\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade ‚Äúinciting violence,‚Äù but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don‚Äôt take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

In case you didn‚Äôt catch our [post](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/18/announcing-the-reddit-internship-for-engineers-rife/) the other week, we‚Äôre running our first ever software development internship program next year. If fetching coffee is your cup of tea, check it out!

This weekend is [Extra Life](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/26/extra-life-is-almost-here-join-team-reddit-on-nov-4th-to-raise-money-for-childrens-hospitals/), a charity gaming marathon benefiting Children‚Äôs Miracle Network Hospitals, and [we have a team](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&id=1251).

<u/spez>: Yes. I forgot to turn Post Replies off today.

Honestly, there have been times over the years, but they are few and far between. Yes, it can be intense and stressful at times, but we are very proud of Reddit and the positive impact it has on people's lives. I know it's not perfect, but we improve every day.

<u/daveime>: > Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks.

Are either of these opt-out?

The new profile pages I've seen leave me lost and confused, but I'll be damned if I'm tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login.

<u/spez>: 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now.

<u/throwmeintothewall>: > easier-to-read

Allow me to disagree. 

<u/spez>: Permission granted.

<u/IranianGenius>: The only use I see for profile pages is [advertisement](/u/IranianGenius) which doesn't make sense for users like me. It's just a way to promote yourself. And I don't even *like* myself.

Edit: I don't need gold. Instead consider subscribing to my [patreon](/r/iraniangenius) which is currently free because I'm not worth your money.

<u/spez>: Ah, well let me share another perspective.

A really important target user of this feature is the original content creator. Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.

Skip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.

I was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.

Hope this gives a little more context to what we're trying to build.

<u/Lurk-Threadwalker>: [This](https://i.imgur.com/WMsdkTP.png) is what I see when I click your username.  
Would you please explain what of the things this presents is relevant and/or useful?  
How does this help me find your latest submissions to either comments or posts?

How is this seemingly random selection of (what really, are those comments or posts or both?) representing you in a meaningful way towards people visiting your page?

Also, are you telling me that it's just coincidence that this feature is super useful to advertisers and not useful to most other users?

<u/spez>: You have a plugin installed that changes the display, probably changed the sort, scrolled down to the middle of the page, and then took a screenshot.

We're totally open to feedback, but I don't think you're approaching this fairly. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It‚Äôs been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I‚Äôd check in and share a few updates.

It‚Äôs been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit‚Äôs web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we‚Äôll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We‚Äôve got a long way to go, but the feedback we‚Äôve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you‚Äôd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We‚Äôve made many other changes as well, and if you‚Äôre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go‚Ä¶\).

<u/ColdFury96>: Is the front page still limited to a random sampling of 50 of your subscribed subreddits (100 if gold)??  I always find this a frustrating limitation of reddit's technology, as I feel like I'm missing items from subreddits I care about unless I slice them up into many different multi-reddits.

<u/spez>: It's not 50, but there is a limit. I think it's 100 now but increasing to a few hundred in a couple weeks.

Even better, we're testing an entirely new algorithm that doesn't have this limitation and shows you more from smaller communities you frequent. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/spez>: First answer: the average age of a post on Reddit's page is dramatically lower now than it was 3-4 years ago (a couple hours vs close to 20). I think people's expectations are higher.

Second answer: the mobile app is much more aggressive about content turnover. We have a test running where every time you open the app you see new content.

The web behavior lags because we're in the middle of rebuilding it, but it'll speed up as well. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We‚Äôve made many other changes as well, and if you‚Äôre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go‚Ä¶\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade ‚Äúinciting violence,‚Äù but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don‚Äôt take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

<u/[deleted]>: Hiya Spez. Does Reddit have any plans to stratify (1) and fix (2) the way moderators work?   
  
(1) The moderator hierarchy is currently top down, which means one stoned/drunk/cranky mod can effectively mess up all mods below them.  
  
I would recommend you think of making permissions more granular than the 6/7 categories that exist (full, access, config, mail, flair, post, wiki). There should be a provision available for mods below to nuke mods on top or change their permissions, if such permissions have been granted to them (and so on). It will make mod lists far more equitable in nature, and reduce the pressure on admins to step in an fix issues.   
  
(2) Additionally, why does Reddit administration disappear on weekends?  
  
Facebook and Twitter are said to be hiring mods, and you can [view a Facebook mods profile here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/facebook-moderators-quick-guide-job-challenges). Why doesn't Reddit think of doing this - hiring sitewide "supermods" who aren't exactly admins but not pleb mods either, to step in and stop blatant vote manipulation (like the sock guy) or dox and stuff.   
  
This is especially necessary on the weekends, when it is hard to get any response from admins. I've seen calls for hiring "supermods" on a few of these threads, and the admins are kind of mute about this. I'm not sure what you think of this so please let me know.  
  


<u/spez>: 1. Great question. Subreddit governance is a huge challenge. We've not tackled it directly to date because there has been so much foundational work to get out of the way first (e.g. moderator guidelines, real mod tools, fully developed community team). We're getting closer.

2. We are still a small company, fewer than 300 people. We're actively hiring for weekend coverage right now, so hopefully the next time we chat we have this problem solved.

<u/[deleted]>: > real mod tools

Just to follow up, I think moderator permissions are tools in themselves. A lot of subreddits organize mod's duties and rules by the permissions they have, and you're kind of glossing over this crucial fact.   
  
Anyway thanks for replying, happy thanksgiving and ban /r/onionhate before /u/sodypop wakes up

<u/spez>: You're right, adding more mod permissions is an easy improvement. We have a "moderators" dev team now. At the moment they're working on an enhanced mod queue, subreddit styling, and a new flair system.

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: Yep. Proper mod tools for mobile are in development now. They'll ship in the next major (4.0) release, which we expect this year. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/vinsfeld08>: Over the years, Reddit has grown from small groups of people submitting content to subs and sharing with each other in a series of available public forums to a number one site on the internet. Now, in addition to private parties sharing what they love, we have corporations, political figures, and media outlets using this as a social media platform not just as a means of contracting with fans/customers/constituents, but as a means of pushing an agenda. While the web traffic is appealing, I have to ask: Is this in line with the original vision for Reddit? Is this how we can expect the future to be, or is there hope of some change to the way Reddit is used by those with money to influence the content on this site?

<u/spez>: The original vision for Reddit was quite small. We wanted to build a place where people could find new and interesting things online. Specifically, we wanted the site to have the community feel of Slashdot but with content curated by users.

As Reddit has grown, so has our vision. Reddit provides human connection and belonging, for which we believe people have a fundamental need. People come to Reddit to stay informed, to laugh, to learn, to argue, for support, to talk about freaky sex stuff... Reddit means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we want to provide our service for everyone on the planet.

Of course, the increase in size means we attract people who want to exploit us. We at Reddit Inc will do our best to prevent this, and the greater Reddit community will fight it as well.

Reddit is the most human place on the Internet, we'll fight to preserve this as hard as we can. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

In the last year, [you've hired almost 100 engineers](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/30/reddit-focuses-on-strengthening-communities-as-site-gets-makeover/), but I can't name a single new admin that handles community issues or interacts with the community publicly. [The jobs page](https://about.reddit.com/careers/) has 22 engineering positions listed, 13 sales, 9 product, and **two** for community (and one of them is a management position, not an actual community job).

Why is hiring community people such an incredibly low priority?

<u/daveime>: > Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks.

Are either of these opt-out?

The new profile pages I've seen leave me lost and confused, but I'll be damned if I'm tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login.

<u/spez>: 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now.

<u/throwmeintothewall>: > easier-to-read

Allow me to disagree. 

<u/spez>: Permission granted.

<u/IranianGenius>: The only use I see for profile pages is [advertisement](/u/IranianGenius) which doesn't make sense for users like me. It's just a way to promote yourself. And I don't even *like* myself.

Edit: I don't need gold. Instead consider subscribing to my [patreon](/r/iraniangenius) which is currently free because I'm not worth your money.

<u/spez>: Ah, well let me share another perspective.

A really important target user of this feature is the original content creator. Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.

Skip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.

I was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.

Hope this gives a little more context to what we're trying to build. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/daveime>: > Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks.

Are either of these opt-out?

The new profile pages I've seen leave me lost and confused, but I'll be damned if I'm tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login.

<u/spez>: 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now.

<u/7hr0wn>: >The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone

Please reconsider that. At least give us the option to opt-out of the new profiles. I don't find them to be easier-to-read, and judging from the comments below, I'm not the only one who doesn't like them.

<u/spez>: The old pages are still accessible. Whether we build an opt-out or leave it as a link depends on the feedback we receive. One of the reasons we do these posts is to gauge sentiment around upcoming changes.

That said, presently less than 1% of logged-in users switch to the old pages or use a plugin. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It‚Äôs been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I‚Äôd check in and share a few updates.

It‚Äôs been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit‚Äôs web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we‚Äôll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We‚Äôve got a long way to go, but the feedback we‚Äôve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you‚Äôd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We‚Äôve made many other changes as well, and if you‚Äôre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go‚Ä¶\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade ‚Äúinciting violence,‚Äù but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don‚Äôt take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

<u/spez>: Reddit Inc looks for bots and other forms of manipulation. Whether around politics, advertising, or general cheating, we spend quite a bit of time on this, and have since pretty much the beginning. Everyone once and a while someone gets the best of us, but we continually improve, and it's rare they succeed twice.

Reddit itself is more resilient than other places online because our community is generally pretty good at sniffing out bullshit, and structure of our site means any one viewpoint isn't seen and accepted by everyone.

People have this notion that something is either misinformation or not, but the reality is there is a lot of space between misinformation, satire, people just being wrong, trolling, and biased reporting.

That said, our largest news communities strictly enforce specific rules about which sources are considered valid. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/[deleted]>: Hiya Spez. Does Reddit have any plans to stratify (1) and fix (2) the way moderators work?   
  
(1) The moderator hierarchy is currently top down, which means one stoned/drunk/cranky mod can effectively mess up all mods below them.  
  
I would recommend you think of making permissions more granular than the 6/7 categories that exist (full, access, config, mail, flair, post, wiki). There should be a provision available for mods below to nuke mods on top or change their permissions, if such permissions have been granted to them (and so on). It will make mod lists far more equitable in nature, and reduce the pressure on admins to step in an fix issues.   
  
(2) Additionally, why does Reddit administration disappear on weekends?  
  
Facebook and Twitter are said to be hiring mods, and you can [view a Facebook mods profile here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/facebook-moderators-quick-guide-job-challenges). Why doesn't Reddit think of doing this - hiring sitewide "supermods" who aren't exactly admins but not pleb mods either, to step in and stop blatant vote manipulation (like the sock guy) or dox and stuff.   
  
This is especially necessary on the weekends, when it is hard to get any response from admins. I've seen calls for hiring "supermods" on a few of these threads, and the admins are kind of mute about this. I'm not sure what you think of this so please let me know.  
  


<u/spez>: 1. Great question. Subreddit governance is a huge challenge. We've not tackled it directly to date because there has been so much foundational work to get out of the way first (e.g. moderator guidelines, real mod tools, fully developed community team). We're getting closer.

2. We are still a small company, fewer than 300 people. We're actively hiring for weekend coverage right now, so hopefully the next time we chat we have this problem solved.

<u/[deleted]>: > real mod tools

Just to follow up, I think moderator permissions are tools in themselves. A lot of subreddits organize mod's duties and rules by the permissions they have, and you're kind of glossing over this crucial fact.   
  
Anyway thanks for replying, happy thanksgiving and ban /r/onionhate before /u/sodypop wakes up

<u/spez>: You're right, adding more mod permissions is an easy improvement. We have a "moderators" dev team now. At the moment they're working on an enhanced mod queue, subreddit styling, and a new flair system. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition.

<u/tecnocrat>: What is reddit doing to find and shut down toxic communities before they rise to the level of media prominence?

<u/spez>: We have a more clear content policy than we've had in the past, we've staffed our team to handle more load, and we have internal processes to speed decision making.

The result is that we are in fact getting to toxic communities far quicker than we have in the past. This is evidenced by the size of communities themselves. In 2015/16, these communities were often 50k+ subscribers. In the most recent wave, the largest community was about 7k. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/Nivrap>: Dear u/spez ,

As a frequenter of many different subreddits, some of which are based on opposed ideologies, I must ask: how are you planning to deal with subreddits that automatically ban users based on their participation in other subs? On more than one occasion, I've received messages from subreddits I've never heard of simply for commenting on a post in an unrelated subreddit. This practice violates Reddit's guidelines and discriminates against users based on ideology. Can we expect any form of help in keeping Reddit one of the few remaining sites dedicated to neutrality?

<u/spez>: Short answer, yes.

Long answer, we created moderator guidelines outlawing the practice, but we also understand the context in which these ban bots were created. We're working with those communities, enhancing mod tools, and planning more transparency for bans so we can get there in time. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition.

<u/[deleted]>: 1. Please remove r/ice_poseidon from r/all, or maybe reddit altogether. It's a whole sub dedicated to abusing and bullying a streamers girlfriend and this week has taken to spamming porn. It's toxic.

2. You owe the community an explanation as to why the_donald is allowed to continue to operate after another one of reddits famous clean ups.

Thanks.

Edit 2: seeing as this is gaining prominence perhaps.we can talk about r/freshmodels and why reddit is ok with paedophilia?

Edit: by r/all I meant r/popular. However u/spez has chosen to pretend that I edited in my second question for some reason. To clarify; I did not.

<u/spez>: We're taking another pass at r/popular, Reddit's default listing, as we speak, and I expect their remove.

r/all will remain unfiltered, but it's opt-in.

edit: you added a second question after I answered. See my [response re the_donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx/).

<u/IranianGenius>: Any chance that users will be able to filter more than 100 subreddits?

For users who don't want politics, games they don't play, certain memes, or certain nsfw subs, surely the count is well over 100 now. Not to mention languages we can't speak so we can't really participate in those. There are so many subreddits big enough to hit /r/all now. 

<u/spez>: I'm not sure off the top of my head if there is a performance reason or if it's arbitrary. I can follow up, and if it's the latter, it's an easy change. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

We just opened this year's exchange a few hours ago, so please join us in spreading a little holiday cheer by [signing up today](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2017/).

Speaking of the holidays, I‚Äôm no longer allowed to use a computer over the Thanksgiving holiday, so I‚Äôd love some ideas to keep me busy.

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers!

<u/TheFoodScientist>: Why does the official Reddit app not support the Reddit video player? Any time I click on a link that contains the video player I get sent to the Reddit mobile page and a pop-up saying how much better Reddit is on the Reddit app. YouTube videos work better than Reddit videos on the Reddit app. Even Twitter videos work better on the Reddit app than Reddit videos do.

Edit: I updated the app and videos from v.redd.it are playing now rather than showing me Reddit mobile and suggesting I use the app.

<u/spez>: Sounds like a bug. The team will investigate and get back to you.

HEY TEAM, INVESTIGATE AND GET BACK TO THIS USER! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It‚Äôs been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I‚Äôd check in and share a few updates.

It‚Äôs been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit‚Äôs web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we‚Äôll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We‚Äôve got a long way to go, but the feedback we‚Äôve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you‚Äôd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We‚Äôve made many other changes as well, and if you‚Äôre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go‚Ä¶\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade ‚Äúinciting violence,‚Äù but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don‚Äôt take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

<u/daveime>: > Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks.

Are either of these opt-out?

The new profile pages I've seen leave me lost and confused, but I'll be damned if I'm tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login.

<u/spez>: 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now.

<u/lenaro>: They're not easier to read. They're fucking awful. 

For everyone else who wants to block profile pages for now, you can use this greasemonkey script: https://github.com/kimpeek/Overview-Redirect

<u/[deleted]>: Hiya Spez. Does Reddit have any plans to stratify (1) and fix (2) the way moderators work?   
  
(1) The moderator hierarchy is currently top down, which means one stoned/drunk/cranky mod can effectively mess up all mods below them.  
  
I would recommend you think of making permissions more granular than the 6/7 categories that exist (full, access, config, mail, flair, post, wiki). There should be a provision available for mods below to nuke mods on top or change their permissions, if such permissions have been granted to them (and so on). It will make mod lists far more equitable in nature, and reduce the pressure on admins to step in an fix issues.   
  
(2) Additionally, why does Reddit administration disappear on weekends?  
  
Facebook and Twitter are said to be hiring mods, and you can [view a Facebook mods profile here](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/21/facebook-moderators-quick-guide-job-challenges). Why doesn't Reddit think of doing this - hiring sitewide "supermods" who aren't exactly admins but not pleb mods either, to step in and stop blatant vote manipulation (like the sock guy) or dox and stuff.   
  
This is especially necessary on the weekends, when it is hard to get any response from admins. I've seen calls for hiring "supermods" on a few of these threads, and the admins are kind of mute about this. I'm not sure what you think of this so please let me know.  
  


<u/spez>: 1. Great question. Subreddit governance is a huge challenge. We've not tackled it directly to date because there has been so much foundational work to get out of the way first (e.g. moderator guidelines, real mod tools, fully developed community team). We're getting closer.

2. We are still a small company, fewer than 300 people. We're actively hiring for weekend coverage right now, so hopefully the next time we chat we have this problem solved. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/loki_racer>: Why aren't alpha testers getting responses from admins?  I asked what the goal of the redesign is and the question went completely unanswered.

So......what is the goal of the redesign?  What makes it a success?  Without a goal, we're all just yelling out suggestions pretending to have opinions that matter.

>I'm new here, so I'm sorry if this has been explained and I missed it, but what is the goal of the redesign?

>As a web developer with 13 years of experience, it makes me nervous to see a redesign project without a clearly defined goal. Did a [pointy-haired boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss) just walk in one day and announce a redesign? What goal determines that the redesign is successful? Without that we're all just a bunch of chiefs shouting out suggestions.

<u/spez>: I'm not sure the forum in which you're not getting responses. If you clarify, I will follow up with the team. However I can assure you we are receiving great feedback and even if you don't get a direct response from us, we are making a ton of improvements based on what we're hearing from testers.

There are a variety of goals, but chief among them is decreasing the bounce rate of first-time visitors and increasing time on site for everyone.

More generally, Reddit grows primarily through word of mouth. Many of us evangelize Reddit and tell people how awesome it is, what an impact it's made in their life, how much it makes them laugh, etc, and then when those new people decide to check out Reddit for the first time they're greeted with dystopian Craigslist. We'd like to fix that. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

Hello Everyone!

It‚Äôs been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I‚Äôd check in and share a few updates.

It‚Äôs been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit‚Äôs web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we‚Äôll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We‚Äôve got a long way to go, but the feedback we‚Äôve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you‚Äôd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We‚Äôve made many other changes as well, and if you‚Äôre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go‚Ä¶\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade ‚Äúinciting violence,‚Äù but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don‚Äôt take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

<u/[deleted]>: 1. Please remove r/ice_poseidon from r/all, or maybe reddit altogether. It's a whole sub dedicated to abusing and bullying a streamers girlfriend and this week has taken to spamming porn. It's toxic.

2. You owe the community an explanation as to why the_donald is allowed to continue to operate after another one of reddits famous clean ups.

Thanks.

Edit 2: seeing as this is gaining prominence perhaps.we can talk about r/freshmodels and why reddit is ok with paedophilia?

Edit: by r/all I meant r/popular. However u/spez has chosen to pretend that I edited in my second question for some reason. To clarify; I did not.

<u/spez>: We're taking another pass at r/popular, Reddit's default listing, as we speak, and I expect their remove.

r/all will remain unfiltered, but it's opt-in.

edit: you added a second question after I answered.

<u/spez>: Many of these links are probably in violation of our policy, but most are unreported, which is what alerts the mods and our team, especially when there are few votes. We'll consider them reported now.

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

Finally, the_donald is a small part of a large problem we face in this country‚Äîthat a large part of the population feels unheard, and the last thing we're going to do is take their voice away.

<u/herennius>: Why was it only in the last week that the new policy on violence was instated?

What is the process like for considering and implementing new/changed policies?

<u/spez>: There were two main reasons. The first is that we take our time on policy changes. We want to be thoughtful about the policy itself, which takes time, and the policy roll-out was done in conjunction with mass enforcement actions, which also take time to plan and coordinate.

The second reason is that we waited until we had more staff on our Trust and Safety team so we guarantee coverage.

Finally, in the wake of Charlottesville, which was my home for five years, I was quite emotional, and it took time to think clearly about what we were going to do. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/daveime>: > Additionally, we‚Äôll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks.

Are either of these opt-out?

The new profile pages I've seen leave me lost and confused, but I'll be damned if I'm tying my Facebook profile or mobile phone number to my login.

<u/spez>: 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition. Reddit CEO here, AMA.

<u/Geopolitics1555>: How are you preventing Russian bots from meddling with the reddit experience? 

<u/spez>: This is the domain of the Anti-Evil team that I've mentioned in previous posts. They are the engineering team whose mandate is to prevent those who cheat, manipulate, and otherwise attempt to undermine Reddit.

I can't get too specific in this forum, but we detect and prevent manipulation in a variety of ways, generally looking at where accounts come from, how they work together, and behaviors of groups of accounts that differ from typical behavior.

Folks have been trying to manipulate Reddit for a long time, so this is not a new problem for us. Their tactics and our responses do evolve over time, so it's been constant work for us over the years. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Time for my quarterly inquisition.

<u/AlRoker666>: Why is a group of squid not called a squad?

<u/spez>: Is there even such a thing as a group of squid? I thought they were they were independent types. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: Update on site-wide rules regarding violent content

Hello All--

We want to let you know that we have made some updates to our site-wide rules regarding violent content. We did this to alleviate user and moderator confusion about allowable content on the site. We also are making this update so that Reddit‚Äôs content policy better reflects our values as a company. 

In particular, we found that the policy regarding ‚Äúinciting‚Äù violence was too vague, and so we have made an effort to adjust it to be more clear and comprehensive. Going forward, we will take action against any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against an individual or a group of people; likewise, we will also take action against content that glorifies or encourages the abuse of animals. This applies to ALL content on Reddit, including memes, CSS/community styling, flair, subreddit names, and usernames. 

We understand that enforcing this policy may often require subjective judgment, so all of the usual caveats apply with regard to content that is newsworthy, artistic, educational, satirical, etc, as mentioned in the policy. Context is key. The policy is posted in the help [center here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-violent-content). 

**EDIT**: Signing off, thank you to everyone who asked questions! Please feel free to send [us any other questions](https://www.reddit.com/contact/). As a reminder, Steve is doing an AMA in r/announcements next week. 


<u/Deimorz>: Why is this posted in /r/modnews and not /r/announcements? All users should be informed about site-wide rules changes, not only moderators.

<u/landoflobsters>: As this is a clarification/update of an existing rule, we wanted to post here first. However, Steve will be doing an AMA next week in r/announcements and this update will be covered. 

<u/[deleted]>: Does /u/spez want to save us all some time and just x-post the announcement to /r/subredditdrama when he posts it?

<u/spez>: mod me pls <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Hi All,

We‚Äôve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We‚Äôre happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it‚Äôs been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It‚Äôs incredible how much we‚Äôre building, and we‚Äôre excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We‚Äôre creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can‚Äôt wait for you all to see what we‚Äôre working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We‚Äôre making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we‚Äôre phasing out Do Not Track, which isn‚Äôt supported by all browsers, doesn‚Äôt work on mobile, and is implemented by few‚Äîif any‚Äîadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don‚Äôt catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I‚Äôll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I‚Äôll be here a couple hours.

‚ÄìSteve

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/shamelessnameless>: my only question is with this profile thing. are you pushing for all that continuous internet identity crap that facebook and twitter and everyone else are doing? because i would hate that. i use this username for porn. a lot of porn. a hell of a lot of porn. and venting.

i don't want to live on a reddit where my porn enjoyment affects my employability in the non-porn sector spez.

don't do that social media shit please, keep this is a news and niche subject site.

<u/spez>: 1) We generally exclude NSFW from any sort of personalization

2) The main goal of profile pages is to give folks a place to host their content, not to build a social network. While the feature is far from complete‚Äîit'll be much more cohesive in a couple months‚Äîyou won't be required to share your identity, have friends, etc.

<u/nopuppet__nopuppet>: Are you going to be responding to the feedback posted in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/60p3n1/tldr_today_were_testing_out_a_new_feature_that/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=announcements) that was overwhelmingly negative? You guys promised to take in all the feedback and as far as I can tell, it's been completely disregarded.

You're usually pretty good about keeping us ~~appraised~~ apprised of any changes so the lack of detail here is implying that there have been none, and that would be disappointing. 

So...any update?

<u/spez>: I more or less answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/dkz5xi4/).

The short answer is: there was some good feedback in that thread, but also plenty that isn't super relevant. With profile pages in particular, I think showing will be better than telling. It's going to take some time for it to be a cohesive product.

The feedback was received, and I think when the dust settles it'll be received much better.

Update: I realize I didn't actually give you a a product update. Profile pages as a feature are about 25% complete. We have a lightly redesigned page (temporary) and personal subreddits. This gives people a place to post, but not much incentive to do so. What we're missing that we believe makes this feature more cohesive are privacy controls, smart comment display (most reddit original content are in comments), and x-posting as a first-class feature (e.g. u/shitty_watercolour can post to his profile and he or others can x-post in r/comics or r/funny or whatever). I generally don't like sharing features before they actually exist, but that's the gist of what's to come over the next couple of months.

<u/WeylandTheDwarf>: With all due respect, this sounds alot like:

You wouldn't be negative if you understood what I'm doing. Once I'm finished you'll like it. If you don't like it, you'll probably be done complaining by then and I can continue doing what I want.

If there is no chance of you backing down on a decision, then it seems misleading to ask for criticism. Moving forward to test the waters seems fair if you are willing to unwind the decision if there is still criticism. Otherwise, it's sounds more like you were wanting positive feedback rather than actual criticism.

<u/spez>: > You wouldn't be negative if you understood what I'm doing. Once I'm finished you'll like it. If you don't like it, you'll probably be done complaining by then and I can continue doing what I want.

You're not wrong. It's more like, once we've released more, your feedback will be more valuable, but right now the product is in its infancy so it doesn't make much sense. That said, we've actually have learned a lot, so I'm content with the current situation. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/hansjens47>: > This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period 

As a mod, all the mods I've spoken to recently say they've either 

a) stopped trying to report spam to the admins because nothing happens with most of those reports anyway after the recent loosening in spam what you consider spam.

or 

b) stopped trying to report most rule-breaking because it now takes so long to get an admin response for most issues by that time the report's too old to do anything meaningful about. You can say average response times are going down, but that's not a good measure of how tickets are being responded to.

Your presentation of this as a win rather than a huge negative is just another step in continuation of the rapidly deteriorating relationship between admins and mods.

It's no wonder so many mods express frustration about the lack of understanding from admins about the needs. What's up with that terrible change to the reports system to make it a terribly cumbersome process that simultaneously encourages people to block people to create their own echo chambers.

I get that you're launching a bunch of changes without hearing user feedback because you wouldn't have changed the feature releases due to feedback anyway. That's fine, not leading people on.

But reddit's corporate voice feels less and less sincere. The site's users can tell.

<u/spez>: You are making a couple of incorrect assumptions.

We've reduced spam by 95% over the last year. There is significantly less spam to report. Yes, there is still spam, and reporting it is still valuable.

It's true you don't get an admin response on every report. We receive millions of reports every month. The entire company is 230 people, with the T&S team being significantly smaller, so we can't possible respond to every one of them. The reports are valuable, however. They point the T&S and AE teams in the right direction so they can fight abuse at scale.

You may feel we're less sincere, but we're not. We all love Reddit as much as ever, and our goal is to make it as good as possible. We can't do everything at once,  and we know we have a long way to go, but we've made a lot of progress.


<u/AssuredlyAThrowAway>: Didn't you remove the 10% rule for self spammers though... you didn't address that point?

<u/spez>: That was an outdated rule from before users could make their own subreddits. Reddit was one community, and we felt it was unfair to promote only one thing. Reddit was all links (this was before self posts as well) back then with very little original content.

However, times have changed. 

The 10% rule was hostile to original content producers, which is ironic because original content is the most valuable. Why would we require you post 9 random posts for every 1 original post?

Moderators are free to moderator however they like, however.

<u/FormerlyPrettyNeat>: Does this mean you're going to begin phasing in a more "curated" front page, a la FB? Because, plz no. (And if I'm reading it wrong, my apologies.)

<u/spez>: Sort of, but not exactly. On Reddit, you will have control. You can curate your own listing (i.e. Home), see what the world is into today (r/popular), or see what other parts of the world are into (geo popular). We believe giving the user explicit control is the way to go.

<u/_S_A>: >r/popular

Are you going to completely get rid of r/all? I like when the seedier parts show up that i don't think popular gets

<u/spez>: I don't think so, but it's never really been a first-class citizen. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

We‚Äôre making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we‚Äôre phasing out Do Not Track, which isn‚Äôt supported by all browsers, doesn‚Äôt work on mobile, and is implemented by few‚Äîif any‚Äîadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don‚Äôt catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I‚Äôll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I‚Äôll be here a couple hours.

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/TAKEitTOrCIRCLEJERK>: Hi spez!

You're talking about community hitting their stride, but I think you lost your Director of Community within the last couple months. From what I can tell, he was a well-accomplished guy, so I found that strange. 

Most importantly from our perspective, he was very transparent, especially with the mod teams.

Can you comment on whether or not you'll be continuing the outreach and transparency that we enjoyed under AchievementUnlockd's community leadership?

<u/spez>: Yep. We miss u/AchievementUnlockd, but the team continues to grow. I hope you haven't felt a decline in our outreach. I believe it's higher than ever (we measure this a lot of ways, but one of them is the number of r/modsupport posts that have constructive answers, from us or others).

New feature roll-outs generally include a fair amount of mod testing. Right now it's video, the redesign, and profile pages in the spotlight. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Hi All,

We‚Äôve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We‚Äôre happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it‚Äôs been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It‚Äôs incredible how much we‚Äôre building, and we‚Äôre excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We‚Äôre creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can‚Äôt wait for you all to see what we‚Äôre working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy.

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/yashendra2797>: I'm sorry, but I (like many) are firmly against the geo-specific version of Reddit. Many of us fell in love with Reddit primarily because it was global. It didn't matter if you were in India (like me), or France, or Korea, you saw what was going on in the world. The problem that many of us predict is that we will see Reddit become just another Facebook, with all new users succumbing to the ecosystem.

The key ideal of Reddit is that it helped expand the minds of many who came here. We all changed our opinions as we interacted with people throughout the globe, and expanded our horizons into things we normally would. 

I'll be honest /u/spez. Many of us core users are afraid that new features like removing CSS, Reddit profiles, and geo specific frontpages will keep users firmly limited to their own ideas and thought processes, and change the uniqueness of each community. I was ambivalent to the first 2 changes, but this is one where I'm legitimately concerned.

Also, there's the problem of new users being turned off by the echo chamber. I for example, rarely visit /r/india, despite being an Indian living in India. Will I be forced to see political posts and the general flustercuck of my region? Because if that happens, I'd rather just switch to Facebook.

Key thing is IMO you are limiting the kind of Redditors that made Reddit great in the first place, and instead inviting more and more  of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp.

<u/spez>: > instead inviting more and more of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp

r/gatekeeping

Stop. Reddit is 300M+ people. It's a big place, and according to users, it has been in steady decline for over a decade now.

The reality is not everyone is interested in an English-only, US-centric view of the world.

The work we are doing is purely additive. Don't like geo-popular? Don't use it. Don't like profile pages? Don't use it. Want to hang out on r/all all day? Cool. It's not going anywhere.

<u/jstrydor>: > Don't like profile pages? Don't use it. 

Don't use them*

Gotta watch out for mistakes like that Spez, they can stick around and haunt you for years to come. 

<u/spez>: I meant profile pages as a singular noun for the feature. Can't decide if I want to change it.

Your feedback is valuable, and we'll take it into consideration.‚Ñ¢ <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/explorer_c37>: As a startup guy myself, I understand where you're going with all these and what your ambitions are.

But as a user of Reddit for ~8 years, I'm not very happy.
______________

If there is negative feedback during the beta stage of a feature, isn't it much more beneficial for a company to roll back and keep the core base happy instead of investing on features that no one wants? You do understand that no one wants the features you're pushing on us, (as far as I've seen). From one founder to another, I'd suggest you don't implement these unwanted features and save yourself from loss of daily users. 

<u/spez>: Assuming we're talking about profile pages...

> If there is negative feedback during the beta stage of a feature, isn't it much more beneficial for a company to roll back

Not always. It takes time to get these things right, which is why we're moving slowly. We received a lot of feedback, some of which was actionable (e.g. more privacy controls), some of which isn't useful (e.g. you're turning in Facebook!).

The reality is the feature isn't yet cohesive, so much of the user feedback lacks context. I wish we could do a perfect job explaining what we're trying to do, but sometimes it's better to just build it, launch it, and see how it's used. In this case, we're still early in the process. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/hansjens47>: > This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period 

As a mod, all the mods I've spoken to recently say they've either 

a) stopped trying to report spam to the admins because nothing happens with most of those reports anyway after the recent loosening in spam what you consider spam.

or 

b) stopped trying to report most rule-breaking because it now takes so long to get an admin response for most issues by that time the report's too old to do anything meaningful about. You can say average response times are going down, but that's not a good measure of how tickets are being responded to.

Your presentation of this as a win rather than a huge negative is just another step in continuation of the rapidly deteriorating relationship between admins and mods.

It's no wonder so many mods express frustration about the lack of understanding from admins about the needs. What's up with that terrible change to the reports system to make it a terribly cumbersome process that simultaneously encourages people to block people to create their own echo chambers.

I get that you're launching a bunch of changes without hearing user feedback because you wouldn't have changed the feature releases due to feedback anyway. That's fine, not leading people on.

But reddit's corporate voice feels less and less sincere. The site's users can tell.

<u/spez>: You are making a couple of incorrect assumptions.

We've reduced spam by 95% over the last year. There is significantly less spam to report. Yes, there is still spam, and reporting it is still valuable.

It's true you don't get an admin response on every report. We receive millions of reports every month. The entire company is 230 people, with the T&S team being significantly smaller, so we can't possible respond to every one of them. The reports are valuable, however. They point the T&S and AE teams in the right direction so they can fight abuse at scale.

You may feel we're less sincere, but we're not. We all love Reddit as much as ever, and our goal is to make it as good as possible. We can't do everything at once,  and we know we have a long way to go, but we've made a lot of progress.

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/Tragouls>: Geo-specific versions of Reddit seem weird and almost scary to me, fencing off different parts of the world seems like it may create echo-boxes similar to what some more vocal sub-reddits do already.

edit: Added a word to create more clarity.

<u/spez>: This is a reasonable concern that we share.

On one hand, we want the site to be more relevant to folks all over the world, and geo-specific versions of Reddit increase the odds that a first time user will find something relevant to them.

However, if we get really good at relevancy that means we've gotten really good at creating echo-chambers, which is not our goal.

For as far as we can see, there will continue to be a few different ways to interact with Reddit: your Home feed, which is stuff you've explicitly chosen, r/popular, which is stuff the whole world finds interesting, and optional geo versions of r/popular, which are a little more specific to your location.

The product evolution is fluid, and we'll keep an eye on things as we evolve.

<u/jstrydor>: Will there be an option to opt out of the geo stuff? I don't want to be stuck just looking at rocks all day. 

<u/spez>: It's just a menu. You can choose which view you'd like to see. The only real change is that a new user visiting in specific location will by default see things biased by other users in that location.

For example, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/ on the web and play with the "popular in" dropdown below Hot.

<u/jstrydor>: > For example, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/ on the web and play with the "popular in" dropdown below Hot.

I might just be missing it but I can't see a dropdown anywhere.

<u/spez>: It might be in a test...

Imagine a dropdown that says "Popular In" and upon clicking it you see options like Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

We‚Äôre happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it‚Äôs been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It‚Äôs incredible how much we‚Äôre building, and we‚Äôre excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We‚Äôre creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can‚Äôt wait for you all to see what we‚Äôre working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We‚Äôre making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we‚Äôre phasing out Do Not Track, which isn‚Äôt supported by all browsers, doesn‚Äôt work on mobile, and is implemented by few‚Äîif any‚Äîadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don‚Äôt catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I‚Äôll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I‚Äôll be here a couple hours.

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/yashendra2797>: I'm sorry, but I (like many) are firmly against the geo-specific version of Reddit. Many of us fell in love with Reddit primarily because it was global. It didn't matter if you were in India (like me), or France, or Korea, you saw what was going on in the world. The problem that many of us predict is that we will see Reddit become just another Facebook, with all new users succumbing to the ecosystem.

The key ideal of Reddit is that it helped expand the minds of many who came here. We all changed our opinions as we interacted with people throughout the globe, and expanded our horizons into things we normally would. 

I'll be honest /u/spez. Many of us core users are afraid that new features like removing CSS, Reddit profiles, and geo specific frontpages will keep users firmly limited to their own ideas and thought processes, and change the uniqueness of each community. I was ambivalent to the first 2 changes, but this is one where I'm legitimately concerned.

Also, there's the problem of new users being turned off by the echo chamber. I for example, rarely visit /r/india, despite being an Indian living in India. Will I be forced to see political posts and the general flustercuck of my region? Because if that happens, I'd rather just switch to Facebook.

Key thing is IMO you are limiting the kind of Redditors that made Reddit great in the first place, and instead inviting more and more  of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp.

<u/spez>: > instead inviting more and more of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp

r/gatekeeping

Stop. Reddit is 300M+ people. It's a big place, and according to users, it has been in steady decline for over a decade now.

The reality is not everyone is interested in an English-only, US-centric view of the world.

The work we are doing is purely additive. Don't like geo-popular? Don't use it. Don't like profile pages? Don't use it. Want to hang out on r/all all day? Cool. It's not going anywhere. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Hi All,

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/Tragouls>: Geo-specific versions of Reddit seem weird and almost scary to me, fencing off different parts of the world seems like it may create echo-boxes similar to what some more vocal sub-reddits do already.

edit: Added a word to create more clarity.

<u/spez>: This is a reasonable concern that we share.

On one hand, we want the site to be more relevant to folks all over the world, and geo-specific versions of Reddit increase the odds that a first time user will find something relevant to them.

However, if we get really good at relevancy that means we've gotten really good at creating echo-chambers, which is not our goal.

For as far as we can see, there will continue to be a few different ways to interact with Reddit: your Home feed, which is stuff you've explicitly chosen, r/popular, which is stuff the whole world finds interesting, and optional geo versions of r/popular, which are a little more specific to your location.

The product evolution is fluid, and we'll keep an eye on things as we evolve.

<u/jstrydor>: Will there be an option to opt out of the geo stuff? I don't want to be stuck just looking at rocks all day. 

<u/spez>: It's just a menu. You can choose which view you'd like to see. The only real change is that a new user visiting in specific location will by default see things biased by other users in that location.

For example, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/ on the web and play with the "popular in" dropdown below Hot. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/[deleted]>: Can you elaborate on 1M fewer reports? With spam shutdown, of course reports will drop. 

<u/spez>: The r/spam removal had very little impact on reports, as r/spam had relatively little impact on spam overall. The improvement in reports is mostly on the harassment side (many of which don't come from moderators but individual users). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

 I do have a question, who invested the millions and millions in Reddit, and did they have requirements? 
This is probably not public information, but I think it's really interesting! 

<u/spez>: > who invested the millions and millions in Reddit

The main investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Fidelity, Sequoia, and Vy.

> and did they have requirements?

The main requirement is that we grow the business so one day they get a return. We all agree that Reddit is an incredible opportunity. Yes, we're large now with 300M users, but we're one of a few companies that has a legitimate opportunity for a billion+ users someday. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Anti-Evil is the engineering team that builds tools for T&S and fights abuse at scale. They work closely together, and have made quite an impact in the last year.

<u/99X>: Speaking of trust, what is your stance on advertising that masquerades as regular content? Is that a growing concern going forward as reddit continues to grow? 

<u/spez>: Hitting Reddit's front page with organic-looking content is valuable, so there will always be people trying to game us. Everyone once and a while it succeeds, but rarely more than once.

We do a couple things to fight this: the Anti-Evil team looks for vote cheating and the like, and we provide legitimate alternatives through advertising that are hopefully easier and cheaper than gaming us.

<u/damn_this_is_hard>: As someone who has done advertising through reddit, it is way more worth the money to go black hat and buy votes or to masquerade ads as OC by paying users to post content that rises to the top. Reddit ads don't get the job done in many facets.

Are you guys making the necessary updates to the ad program to prevent this? (Answer is no, I can't target ads by certain subs due to their user device or location or the sub's popularity isn't enough.) Fix these problems and /u/99X's question becomes less of a problem.

<u/spez>: Yes, you can target based on subs, geo, and interests today. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Hi All,

We‚Äôve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We‚Äôre happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it‚Äôs been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It‚Äôs incredible how much we‚Äôre building, and we‚Äôre excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We‚Äôre creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can‚Äôt wait for you all to see what we‚Äôre working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We‚Äôre making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we‚Äôre phasing out Do Not Track, which isn‚Äôt supported by all browsers, doesn‚Äôt work on mobile, and is implemented by few‚Äîif any‚Äîadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don‚Äôt catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I‚Äôll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I‚Äôll be here a couple hours.

‚ÄìSteve

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/0pet>: Can you do something about sponsored posts, bot-upvoted posts, and posts made by bots to advertise?


<u/spez>: This is the domain of the Anti-Evil team. Yes, we look for this stuff. If you see examples of fishiness, you can always PM me, and I'll forward to the team. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/shamelessnameless>: my only question is with this profile thing. are you pushing for all that continuous internet identity crap that facebook and twitter and everyone else are doing? because i would hate that. i use this username for porn. a lot of porn. a hell of a lot of porn. and venting.

i don't want to live on a reddit where my porn enjoyment affects my employability in the non-porn sector spez.

don't do that social media shit please, keep this is a news and niche subject site.

<u/spez>: 1) We generally exclude NSFW from any sort of personalization

2) The main goal of profile pages is to give folks a place to host their content, not to build a social network. While the feature is far from complete‚Äîit'll be much more cohesive in a couple months‚Äîyou won't be required to share your identity, have friends, etc. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

/u/spez, I'm happy for you all, but I do not understand your world at all, haha.

‚ÄìSteve

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/S_A_N_D_>: Can you explain why there is a need to phase out Do Not Track? Unless it somehow causes undue hardship on running the site, I can't see how this is not just a means to grab info. You could easily support both DNT and the new privacy controls. 

Whether or not others use it shouldn't impact your choice to support it unless there is clear impact on site operations or some other reason not to. 

<u/spez>: It creates a development burden with little gain, so it's mostly a distraction. We spend time talking about how DNT should effect such and such feature, but the user gets relatively little benefit.

While it wouldn't be my preferred approach on Reddit, if you really want to control how you're tracked online, you should use an ad blocker. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Hi All,

We‚Äôve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We‚Äôre happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it‚Äôs been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It‚Äôs incredible how much we‚Äôre building, and we‚Äôre excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We‚Äôre creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can‚Äôt wait for you all to see what we‚Äôre working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We‚Äôre making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we‚Äôre phasing out Do Not Track, which isn‚Äôt supported by all browsers, doesn‚Äôt work on mobile, and is implemented by few‚Äîif any‚Äîadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don‚Äôt catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I‚Äôll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I‚Äôll be here a couple hours.

‚ÄìSteve

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/FormerlyPrettyNeat>: Does this mean you're going to begin phasing in a more "curated" front page, a la FB? Because, plz no. (And if I'm reading it wrong, my apologies.)

<u/spez>: Sort of, but not exactly. On Reddit, you will have control. You can curate your own listing (i.e. Home), see what the world is into today (r/popular), or see what other parts of the world are into (geo popular). We believe giving the user explicit control is the way to go. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/Legodude293>: Did you guys feel like talking to senators changed any of their minds?

Edit: I've  decided to never post on announcements again. Reddit stop the name calling, stop the dick measuring, and have discussions on why you think your side of the argument is right. So sick of blah blah racist conservative, blah blah stupid libtard. Well here's something your all assholes.

Edit: you're all assholes. 

<u/spez>: In some cases I think we were able to provide valuable perspective.

On the whole, given the craziness of last Thursday (the healthcare vote), I was impressed they were so engaged with us. Many took time out of a crazy day to chat. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more.

<u/99X>: What do the Trust & Safety and Anti-Evil teams do?

<u/spez>: Trust & Safety is the team that enforces our content policy. They fight abuse, harassment, spam, cheating, etc.

Anti-Evil is the engineering team that builds tools for T&S and fights abuse at scale. They work closely together, and have made quite an impact in the last year.

<u/99X>: Speaking of trust, what is your stance on advertising that masquerades as regular content? Is that a growing concern going forward as reddit continues to grow? 

<u/spez>: Hitting Reddit's front page with organic-looking content is valuable, so there will always be people trying to game us. Everyone once and a while it succeeds, but rarely more than once.

We do a couple things to fight this: the Anti-Evil team looks for vote cheating and the like, and we provide legitimate alternatives through advertising that are hopefully easier and cheaper than gaming us. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/spez>: It's an engineering team, so they go through the normal engineering hiring process. AE is a fun team to be on, and that type of work was some of my favorite when I was an engineer. It's creative and challenging work‚Äîevery day you're facing off against other humans who are trying to ruin Reddit.

I'm desperately hoping for a 'Minority Report' system of mods in a paddling pool.

We build models of past bad behavior to detect future bad behavior before it hits scale (report abuse, login bots, etc). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We‚Äôre happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it‚Äôs been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It‚Äôs incredible how much we‚Äôre building, and we‚Äôre excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We‚Äôre creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can‚Äôt wait for you all to see what we‚Äôre working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We‚Äôre making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we‚Äôre phasing out Do Not Track, which isn‚Äôt supported by all browsers, doesn‚Äôt work on mobile, and is implemented by few‚Äîif any‚Äîadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don‚Äôt catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we‚Äôre catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I‚Äôll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I‚Äôll be here a couple hours.

<u/Tragouls>: Geo-specific versions of Reddit seem weird and almost scary to me, fencing off different parts of the world seems like it may create echo-boxes similar to what some more vocal sub-reddits do already.

edit: Added a word to create more clarity.

<u/spez>: This is a reasonable concern that we share.

On one hand, we want the site to be more relevant to folks all over the world, and geo-specific versions of Reddit increase the odds that a first time user will find something relevant to them.

However, if we get really good at relevancy that means we've gotten really good at creating echo-chambers, which is not our goal.

For as far as we can see, there will continue to be a few different ways to interact with Reddit: your Home feed, which is stuff you've explicitly chosen, r/popular, which is stuff the whole world finds interesting, and optional geo versions of r/popular, which are a little more specific to your location.

The product evolution is fluid, and we'll keep an eye on things as we evolve. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/99X>: What do the Trust & Safety and Anti-Evil teams do?

<u/spez>: Trust & Safety is the team that enforces our content policy. They fight abuse, harassment, spam, cheating, etc.

Anti-Evil is the engineering team that builds tools for T&S and fights abuse at scale. They work closely together, and have made quite an impact in the last year. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: With so much going on in the world, I thought I‚Äôd share some Reddit updates to distract you all

<u/KeyserSosa>: The *original* original deployment scheme was pretty much "\^C the reddit process running in screen on the server."

<u/spez>: It was not.

<u/KeyserSosa>: Detachtty?

<u/spez>: Maybe! The only reason I'm certain it wasn't screen is that I distinctly remember learning about screen thinking, "this will make things so much easier!" <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/programming>: The Evolution of Code Deploys at Reddit

<u/spez>: It was not.

<u/raldi>: I thought the _original_ was that you would type some new Lisp into the REPL that was serving the site, wasn't it? 

And sometimes you even remembered to save it to a file later?

<u/spez>: That's right. We ran Reddit out of a long-living CMUCL process. Instead of reloading everything, I (I'm always hesitant to use I instead of We, but it was really just me doing the dev at the time) updated the process one function at a time by pasting in newly updated code. Because of this, the instance of Reddit running in production wasn't necessarily documented in any specific code.

Hi Mods,

I wanted to follow up on the [CSS and redesign post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/) from a few weeks back and provide some more information as well as clarify some questions that have emerged.

Based on your feedback, we will allow you to continue to use CSS on top of the new structured styles. This will be the last part of the customization tool we build as we want to make sure the structured options we are offering are rock solid. Also, please keep in mind that if you do choose to use the advanced option, we will no longer be treading as carefully as we have done in the past about breaking styles applied through CSS^1.

To give you a sense of our approach, we‚Äôre starting with a handful of highly-customized communities (e.g. r/overwatch and r/gameofthrones) and seeing how close we can get to their existing appearance using the new system. Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported. I know you‚Äôd like to see a list of everything, but we think the best approach will be to show instead of tell, which we‚Äôre racing to as quickly as possible.

The widget system I mentioned in the last post isn‚Äôt directly related. Many communities have added complex functionality over the years (calendars, scoreboards, etc). A widget system will elevate these features to first-class status on Reddit, with the aim of making them both more powerful and reuseable. Yes, we‚Äôre evaluating how we would accept user-created widgets.  We intend for widgets to be able to be updated via the API, so you‚Äôll still be able to create dynamically updating content in your subreddit sidebar.

This change, and the redesign in general, is going to happen slowly.  We will will not be abruptly cutting everyone over to the new site at once.  We know it won‚Äôt be perfect at first (unlike the current site), and plan to include plenty of time to solicit feedback and make iterations.  Sharing our plans for subreddit customization this far advance with you is part of this process.

We‚Äôll start with a small alpha group and create a subreddit to solicit feedback.  As we continue to add features, we‚Äôll expand the testing group to an opt-in beta.  If you‚Äôd like to participate in the alpha please add a reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/dhhmebb/).  Please note, signing up does not guarantee a spot in the alpha.  We want to be able to be responsive to the alpha testers, and keeping the initial group small has proved to be effective in the past.

I‚Äôd like thank everyone who has provided feedback on this topic.  There have been some very [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/677rba/some_brainstorming_about_potential_widgets_in_the) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/66rdiy/crowdsourcing_new_subreddit_widgets/).  I‚Äôd also like to take a moment to appreciate how civil the feedback has been.  This is a topic many of you feel passionate about.  Thank you for keeping things constructive.

Cool?

Cool.

Please note, signing up does not guarantee a spot in the alpha.  We want to be able to be responsive to the alpha testers, and keeping the initial group small has proved to be effective in the past.

I‚Äôd like thank everyone who has provided feedback on this topic.

Hi Mods,

I wanted to follow up on the [CSS and redesign post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/) from a few weeks back and provide some more information as well as clarify some questions that have emerged.

Based on your feedback, we will allow you to continue to use CSS on top of the new structured styles. This will be the last part of the customization tool we build as we want to make sure the structured options we are offering are rock solid. Also, please keep in mind that if you do choose to use the advanced option, we will no longer be treading as carefully as we have done in the past about breaking styles applied through CSS^1.

To give you a sense of our approach, we‚Äôre starting with a handful of highly-customized communities (e.g. r/overwatch and r/gameofthrones) and seeing how close we can get to their existing appearance using the new system. Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported. I know you‚Äôd like to see a list of everything, but we think the best approach will be to show instead of tell, which we‚Äôre racing to as quickly as possible.

<u/cool_creeper500>: Thanks for listening and caring spez, quick question, what led to the ~~dumb~~ idea of removing CSS?

<u/spez>: It was u/powerlanguage. I've been telling him for weeks he's crazy, but r/place really went to his head.

But, actually... Everything I said in the last post is still true. CSS shouldn't be the only way to customize a community. We are still going to build a structured system, which will be more accessible, cross-platform, and less brittle. If we do a job with this and the widget system, I expect CSS to be less required, but we can leave CSS for more advanced use-cases.

I do like the site and I think that as a collective forum, it's pretty frickin great. I think this  might be something everyone else has asked, but I'll ask anyway. There are plenty of forums out there that operate similarly like Reddit. What did you keep in mind when creating Reddit to truly distinguish yourself from the rest of the competition?

<u/spez>: I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the competition. We try to build what's best for Reddit.

<u/[deleted]>: Hello!

Thank you for doing this AMA! Do you have any advice for someone who is looking to accomplish what you've accomplished? I very badly want to create something with my own hands that other people use. Part of it is so that I can work on something I'm passionate about every day, but a lot of it is because I want to see people use what I've created. As a musician, I've had other people listen to my music and comment on it and it's just great. I would love to have other people use my software too! 

I have the technical know-how, I've been developing for about 6 years now. And I have some ideas that could potentially turn into something. I would just like to hear what you went through when you first started Reddit, how you came up with the idea, executed it, and any pitfalls that you could help newbies avoid!

Thanks :) 

<u/spez>: > I very badly want to create something with my own hands that other people use.

Stick with this. I often say I'd be happy installing garage door openers for people. It's fun when other people appreciate your work. We're fortunate that at Reddit we can do it on a worldwide scale, but the feeling is the same. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/spez>: 1. In the beginning, we didn't have a vision. Every day we worked on what we felt like each day. One one hand this was a good thing: the site came from a pure, organic place. One the other, we didn't have a long term vision to focus us, which is why we sold so early.

2. Hash passwords.

3. Spend time with my friends. Ski. Read Reddit. Read books.

4. Test your assumptions. Have a bug? Make sure all your assumptions about the surrounding code are correct. Fix a bug? Make sure you can reproduce it and fix it again.

<u/[deleted]>: Hi Steve,
Not quite career related but while I have the chance to ask you, what is so bad about the Boston area that every startup, including Reddit, that started here runs away to the west coast as soon as they "make it"? What were your reasons?

<u/spez>: We left because we got acquired.

My friends moved here because the startup ecosystem is more mature. If you're starting a company, it's easier to raise money here. If you're looking for work, there are more opportunities. The gap is closing, but the Bay is still the best.

The weather doesn't hurt either. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/spez>: It's not too late. The curse of young people is that they all thing they're old.

Our head of platform didn't start programming until he was about your age.

<u/SergeantFTC>: What about the self taught part?

<u/spez>: Sure, it's possible, but a little harder. School and work force you to do things you might not do on your own, and the willingness to do such things is usually a good signal. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/darexinfinity>: Hi Spez,

I've recently applied to 2 positions on Reddit and gotten back a rejection letter. Does that letter apply to both of my applications or only one? (The letter did not specify either of the positions)

Also, I noticed you have a lot of Senior positions available. How do you feel about engineers who don't have the required number of years experience applying to those positions?

<u/spez>: > Does that letter apply to both of my applications or only one? 

Not sure. PM me, and I will investigate.

> Also, I noticed you have a lot of Senior positions available. How do you feel about engineers who don't have the required number of years experience applying to those positions?

If you can walk the walk, years of experience don't matter.



<u/CriticDanger>: How do you determine if they can 'walk the walk' from their resume? Assuming a lot of candidates get rejected due to experience before an initial interview, what other criteria do you mostly look at?

<u/TheAdventMaster>: A website such as Reddit can probably tell someone who isn't a good fit a lot of the time almost immediately.

If I was a hiring manager for a company like Reddit, and I was looking to fill a Senior position, and I didn't see any skills or experience on a resume that made it obvious this person could reason about how to handle 10,000's simultaneous requests per (some very short period of time, I actually don't know), then that resume's probably going in the trash pile or at least set aside.

The next thing you look at is do they have experience doing these things with the technology your company uses? That way you don't have to cross-train. The ideal employee can get moving fairly quickly.

Do they have general experience in the area? Do they demonstrate a knowledge of some of the specific problem domain areas that we are building solutions for?

As far as what exactly these items need to be, understand that an employer typically knows what these things are (and sometimes publishes the skills they value), but you don't necessarily know what an employer's overall plan for you is going to be. It's going to vary for every company.

For starters, however, Reddit has a very obvious public presence on their blog. They talk about how they build various things in detail. You can see the type of work quality and skills that would be expected from a senior engineer at Reddit by reading their blog posts.

If you start off not having relevant experience, but you read Reddit's blog posts, fork Reddit, implement and re-implement some of these features, dig a little deeper into the specific technologies, try new things... You may qualify for a junior position.

Why just junior? From experience, seniority is all about time. It's about experience. It's about having encountered many real-world scenarios and being able to properly reason about them and estimate how long various efforts will take, and roughly what the expected end product should be.

That's why even if you know every "technical" skill a company like Reddit would want to see, if you're not actually a senior developer in your ability to reason, investigate, debug, estimate, etc. then you simply can't function in that sort of position. It comes from experience only. However, you'll probably have a big jumpstart ahead of other pre-senior level developers and could possibly hit that point much more quickly than your peers.

---

EDIT 2017-04-26: For anyone curious, I was gilded by "a recruiter" (maybe just your "average" recruiter, although I suspect a Reddit employee.) Before I was gilded, I was in the negative.

I'm sorry this is a hard truth for a lot of the CS students on this subreddit, but this is real stuff. The vast majority of resumes I see will get put in the trash pile. It's not easy to fake seniority on a resume, and I can usually weed out liars within 30 seconds of a phone call or in-person interview.

If you think a company that specializes in delivering a high-performance experience to millions of people simultaneously can't tell if you're full of it, I am sorry. I don't know what you were expecting. It is not hard at all to bring an engineer over to look at a resume, or to invite them in an interview, and ask you questions about the skills you supposedly have.

And yes, your resume will be thrown in the trash. Employers try to give feedback when they can, but sometimes your skills are so irrelevant to what they are looking for that they don't always have the time to even redirect you.

Again, just be honest. And if you really want to be valuable to a company, learn about what they do. Give them or one of their teams a call. Read their blog. Dig into the tech infrastructure and learn that thing that they always talk about using. There's no other way. Not everyone is here to hold your hand and train you. We would like that, but realistically the time, effort and money can't always be afforded to do so. There's a balance here, but don't take any bets on it.

<u/jpham1209>: Hey! 
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in CSE and during the first two years I never really knew what I wanted to do in this field so I didn't care about my studies as much until I learned about web development. I've been reviewing data structures and algorithms in Java, retaking classes, just started doing side projects, and went to a hackathon recently to work on a group project. I'm a graduating next year and I'm worried that I won't find a job because my gpa isn't great. I also haven't had a summer internship. 
So my questions are: 

Do you have any advice on what I can work on to improve myself? 

Do companies look at gpa first to determine if I even receive an interview? 

<u/spez>: > Do you have any advice on what I can work on to improve myself?

I find it's often best to give yourself a project. It helps focus your attention. Pick a product you like (Reddit?) and see if you can build it yourself.

> Do companies look at gpa first to determine if I even receive an interview?

I can't speak for others, but if you don't put your GPA on your resume, I'm not going to ask. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/Sujji>: Hi spez,

As an undergraduate CS student, I am sometimes intimidated by the people on this subreddit. What do you think about the importance of knowing algorithms and keeping up to date with the latest and greatest language that this subreddit and others emphasize? As a developer who created an incredibly successful platform, was efficiency and code cleanliness always your priority?

<u/spez>: With any luck, you will be intimidated your entire career. My point is, people who think they have a lot to learn, learn a lot more and more quickly. Do yourself a favor and constantly surround yourself with intimidating people.

You don't need to know every last algorithm, language, and framework, but you do need a enough of a foundation that you could.

> was efficiency and code cleanliness always your priority

hahaha. Have you seen the Reddit code base? The stuff I wrote is a mess. There are lots of reasons for this:

* I was a worse programmer back then
* Ten years and dozens of engineers in a code base often leads to a mess
* We made tradeoffs to ship quickly.

Quality is something that has always been important to me, but more important has been results. Users don't care about your code quality. Plus, every line you write, you probably be able to write it better in a year (because you have more skills and context).

<u/Sugery>: While users don't care about code quality. I'd imagine they care about things working properly. Have you found yourself or your team running into situations where cutting corners in the code-base has led to issues soon after shipping it?

<u/spez>: Yep! One of the hallmarks of experience is getting better at making the right tradeoffs. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/Just_Be_Nice_Man>: How did you go about gathering users for reddit? When it started I'm sure it did not have as much content. How would a person go about pitching there own web app and try to make it successful. 

<u/spez>: When it started, u/kn0thing and I submitted all the content.

I had a script that would scrape a bunch of websites (Slashdot, Boingboing, etc) and print all the links it had never seen before. The first day it printed a bunch of navigational garbage, but on the second day it was all interesting content. We'd write titles for the those links and submit them to Reddit.

Our submit page looked a little bit different: we had an extra field for username. Reddit would automatically register that name if it was available and submit the link as that "new" user.

We did this for about 4 months, if I recall. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/sxeteej>: Hi Spez, I'm going to be starting as a full time developer working strictly on short term iOS, macOS, and watchOS apps. I love the job I'm going to be going into and I couldn't pick a better position to start my career with. However, I worry a lot of the skills I will gain may not be transferable in the future. Any advice on how I can avoid bottlenecking myself and maybe one day be able to become a CTO?

<u/spez>: There are few things you are learning now that *aren't* transferable into the future, so don't worry too much about that.

There are two paths to becoming a CTO:

* Start your own company and be the CTO (that's basically what I did).
* Be the best engineer at the company you work for, and by best engineer, it's more than just being a good programmer. You need to be able to communicate up and down; have a high enough ego to be confident in your decisions, and a low enough ego to constantly be learning; and be flexible enough to take on all sorts of challenges, engineering or not.

e: typo

<u/ipod123432>: On the flipside, if I wanted to go towards management (tech lead, manager, etc.) from the position of a full time developer, what kind of skills or experience or connections (or anything in particular) should I be trying to cultivate?

<u/Robotigan>: Hey spez, I know a lot of companies really emphasize a good attitude/culture fit.  Do you think this leads to any "cliquey-ness" in the industry?

How much can great programming skills make up for an underdeveloped personality?  What is a "bad personality"?

<u/spez>: > Do you think this leads to any "cliquey-ness" in the industry?

I suppose it can. It really depends what you mean by culture. Culture are the things we have in common, so it depends on what you want those things to be. For example Reddit hires a lot of optimists. Does that make us cliquey? Maybe. It also makes Reddit a cheery place to work.

> Are there certain personality traits that, while maybe not flaws per se, just don't gel with your workplace culture?

Ego that outpaces your skill really grinds my gears.

> How much can a great attitude make up for underdeveloped skills?

A great attitude leads to great skills!

> How much can great programming skills make up for an underdeveloped personality? What is a "bad personality"?

I think if you're the sort of person asking these questions, you're probably fine. It's the people unaware of themselves that are unpleasant to work with.

<u/Rennir>: Hi Spez,

I'm a new grad that's been working for a specific company for 6 months so far, and I'm not really liking my job and want to move to a different company. Do you have any advice to someone with 6-12 months of industry experience applying for a job again? Perhaps also how you would view such an application? Would I essentially be considered a new grad for recruiting purposes or be held to a higher standard?

<u/spez>: First, gut-check what you don't like about the company. Make sure it's not something about yourself that you can fix. Otherwise, you'll get a new job and feel the same way in 6 months.

Just a few months at a company raises some questions. We'll be asking why it's so short, and trying to determine whether it's you or the company.

<u/zero2g>: Hi Spez,

Thank you for doing this AMA. The question I have, and from your perspective, for an entry level developer, what is more desirable and your comments on each of these abilities.

Algorithm skills - able to pump out some amazing algorithms and optimize to the best time complexity

System design skills - able to create a scalable and working system that can sustain users and abuse

Coding skills - able to write down neat and refactored code that is easily comprehensible and reviewable by others

Communication skills - able to communicate with other team members well, understand requirements to the point, and communicate ideas fluently

Out of these skills above, what do you look for in an entry level programmer more so? Maybe like a ranking between them? Which skills do you think is necessary for one to have before they get hired, and which ones do you think can be developed on the job?

Other than those mentioned above, what other skills do you think an entry level developer should have?

<u/spez>: For entry level developers I'm looking for three things:

* Do you have skills? If you can write a hashtable, list, and tree in C, you are probably good.
* Do you have a passion for programming?
* Are you a pleasant person to be around? For beginners, I'm looking for high skill and low ego. For whatever reason, newbies tend to have low skill and high ego. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/princemaxx>: Hi Spez!  
Thanks for doing this. What was your major inspiration for creating Reddit?  Also, what advice do you have for current university students who are entrepreneurial in nature, and want to create something big? 

<u/spez>: I'm sorry, I don't have a great answer for you: when we started Reddit, we didn't have a vision for the future. Our product planning horizon was about 1 day. I mostly didn't want to look stupid in front of Paul Graham, who made our first investment.

As for how to make something big, that's a broad question. I suppose if I were to distill it into a single point: it's put yourself in a position to build something big:

* Work on an idea that can actually be big
* Surround yourself with people with similar aspirations
* Work at a company with people who know what they're doing <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/spez>: Make yourself invaluable to your employer. The advice I give to young hires is ask yourself each day, "am I making my manager's life easier or harder?"

If you want to primarily write code, primarily write code. You have a lot of agency here. However, it might be worth giving management a spin someday. Maybe you'll like it! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/dexx4d>: What challenges did you encounter on transitioning from a technical role to senior leadership, and do you have any advice on making the change?  Do you have any regrets about the transition, or things you wish you'd done differently?

<u/spez>: If you asked me ten years ago if I would be happy in a job where I rarely programmed, I would have been shocked that would even be a possibility.

Management is a lot of fun, actually. There is a lot that goes into getting people in alignment and working towards a shared vision. It's also satisfying to unwind and fix people problems. I learn something new every day.

I don't know if I have regrets. I'd like to say I wish I invested in learning these skills sooner, but I appreciate them more now when I can look back at how ineffective I've been in the past. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/spez>: It's evolved over the years. During my prime programming years, I blasted Metallica and the like, but my tastes are pretty broad. I considered myself extremely fortunate to have a job where I could listen to music all day.

I love dancing. These days I listen to a lot of funk and danceable edm, with a liberal amount of Beatles and Fleetwood Mac mixed in to chill out.

Motivation is a funny thing. Many times I've gone through phases where when I get home, the last thing I want to do is look at a computer. I usually bounce back.

*I meant at home, but I suppose you can change it up at work as well.

<u/KrazyTom>: Hi, thanks for doing this.

I have a technical background but never really dove into programming, but with machine learning and neural networking, I am very inclined to start. Does reddit use neural networking or machine learning in any capacity, and if so how?


<u/spez>: Lightly at the moment.  Before building a brain, I always advocate building a simple heuristic-based algorithm first.

<u/110011001100>: EDIT: I deleted this comment, but the crux of the question was if Reddit still has a non negotiation policy, and if so, why

<u/spez>: Yes, we still use it. We used it at Hipmunk as well. There are a handful of reasons for it:

* It's more fair. We're paying people for their level of work, not their ability to negotiate.
* I'd rather start our relationship happy that we found a good fit rather than tense from a negotiation.
* I get no enjoyment getting someone for cheap, but the hire gets a lot of disappointment.
* It's easier. We look up your level in the chart, and that's it. We don't have to do any internal negotiation either.

Every company is different. Some will lowball you because they think they have to. Some will lowball you because they're assholes. Some will come in really high because they have tons of money. We make our best offer first.

<u/cybercuzco>: As someone who also made the transition from engineering to management at one point, how is it going for you?  How did you handle the stress of having to fire people?

<u/spez>: It's going ok. I've never been a great manager. These days I manage executives, who by nature are self-managing.

One thing that helped me is acknowledging my strengths and weaknesses, and playing to the former while minimizing the latter. I'm a good mentor and coach, but I can also be scattered and aloof. I still love working with beginners, but I'm not great a project managing.

When I fire people, I try to get myself into a mental state where I want to do it. Sometimes it's because the person who we're letting go will actually be happier elsewhere. Other times, I think about the time and stress I'm saving someone else on the team. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

<u/Sujji>: Hi spez,

As an undergraduate CS student, I am sometimes intimidated by the people on this subreddit. What do you think about the importance of knowing algorithms and keeping up to date with the latest and greatest language that this subreddit and others emphasize? As a developer who created an incredibly successful platform, was efficiency and code cleanliness always your priority?

<u/spez>: With any luck, you will be intimidated your entire career. My point is, people who think they have a lot to learn, learn a lot more and more quickly. Do yourself a favor and constantly surround yourself with intimidating people.

You don't need to know every last algorithm, language, and framework, but you do need a enough of a foundation that you could.

> was efficiency and code cleanliness always your priority

hahaha. Have you seen the Reddit code base? The stuff I wrote is a mess. There are lots of reasons for this:

* I was a worse programmer back then
* Ten years and dozens of engineers in a code base often leads to a mess
* We made tradeoffs to ship quickly.

Quality is something that has always been important to me, but more important has been results. Users don't care about your code quality. Plus, every line you write, you probably be able to write it better in a year (because you have more skills and context). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO.

<u/catboy96>: Hey Spez, 

Out of curiosity which languages are your favorite and why? 

Edit: programming languages

<u/spez>: I've had favorites over the years for different reasons:

* Lisp: It's so flexible you can adapt to almost any style. The first version of Reddit was written in Common Lisp.
* C: you can't program C without really knowing how computers work.
* Python: My favorite language to read, write, and teach in. Reddit is primarily Python.
* Go: As I've aged, I've developed a deeper and deeper appreciate for types. Go seems to have the right balance of real-word practicality, modern features, and a Python-like feeling of coherence when you finally get it right. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO.

<u/sxeteej>: Hi Spez, I'm going to be starting as a full time developer working strictly on short term iOS, macOS, and watchOS apps. I love the job I'm going to be going into and I couldn't pick a better position to start my career with. However, I worry a lot of the skills I will gain may not be transferable in the future. Any advice on how I can avoid bottlenecking myself and maybe one day be able to become a CTO?

<u/spez>: There are few things you are learning now that *aren't* transferable into the future, so don't worry too much about that.

There are two paths to becoming a CTO:

* Start your own company and be the CTO (that's basically what I did).
* Be the best engineer at the company you work for, and by best engineer, it's more than just being a good programmer. You need to be able to communicate up and down; have a high enough ego to be confident in your decisions, and a low enough ego to constantly be learning; and be flexible enough to take on all sorts of challenges, engineering or not.

The only wrong answer is to do multiple things at once. No matter what you choose, work hard and keep your mind open to learning. There is plenty of time in life to do all these things. You can always change your mind. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO. AMA.

Hello r/cscareerquestions, I‚Äôm Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you‚Äôre on Reddit! And, yes, [we‚Äôre hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators!

<u/spez>: The strongest newbie's I've hired have a couple things in common:

* They have a great attitude. They work on every problem thrown at them, and when they have nothing to do, they find more work. One guy I work with (who worked with me at Hipmunk and is now at Reddit), used to sit next to me and just fix my bugs. I could move a lot faster, and he learned a ton.

* They study outside of work. I think this advice holds true forever, but it's certainly true in the beginning: even a single weekend of studying a specific technology will make you dramatically better. The aforementioned engineer was trying to get better at frontend. Instead of waiting for the work to come to him, he learned an incredible amount of CSS in one weekend and came to work on Monday ready to take on a never level of work he couldn't do on Friday. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: I'm Steve Huffman, programmer and Reddit CEO.

<u/darexinfinity>: Hi Spez,

I've recently applied to 2 positions on Reddit and gotten back a rejection letter. Does that letter apply to both of my applications or only one? (The letter did not specify either of the positions)

Also, I noticed you have a lot of Senior positions available. How do you feel about engineers who don't have the required number of years experience applying to those positions?

<u/spez>: > Does that letter apply to both of my applications or only one? 

Not sure. PM me, and I will investigate.

> Also, I noticed you have a lot of Senior positions available. How do you feel about engineers who don't have the required number of years experience applying to those positions?

If you can walk the walk, years of experience don't matter.

<u/Guardtopian>: Hi spez,

When are there gonna be Reddit internships and how do I get one? 


<u/spez>: **Reddit specific**

We're not doing a formal internship program this year‚Äîwe just have too much going on to do a good job on it. That said, every once and a while someone slips through the cracks into a job here...

**Generic Advice**

Whenever I'm looking at interns / beginners, I'm primarily looking for someone who both has a great attitude and a passion for programming. I know we're hiring someone who doesn't know everything (and hopefully they know that as well...), but the hope is that we're finding the people who will never actually be on the job market (i.e. they get hired as an intern and their employer never lets them go). We have a handful of such folks here. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned we‚Äôre currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we‚Äôve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* It‚Äôs web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We‚Äôd love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: it‚Äôs difficult to learn; it‚Äôs error-prone; and it‚Äôs time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. We‚Äôd like to make changes more quickly. You‚Äôve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

We‚Äôre designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we‚Äôll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We‚Äôd like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? We‚Äôll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you‚Äôll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn‚Äôt going to be easy for everyone, so we‚Äôll assist communities that want help (i.e. we‚Äôll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

We‚Äôre in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we‚Äôll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don‚Äôt have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We‚Äôve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we‚Äôll keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorial‚Äìthankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we‚Äôll be grappling with together‚Äìchanges to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We‚Äôll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.

[Called it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/64s5z2/is_css_customization_going_away/)

I don't support this.

Many subreddits are different, and have different goals or CSS tweaks. I don't see how this will actually be considered a working replacement? For example if 50 subreddits use CSS to add extra buttons like "Read FAQ" below "Submit a new link" but the other 4000+ subreddits don't, would the admins actually give this dev time to implement? Are the admins actually going to implement every use case we moderators use CSS for to accomplish functionality? I don't see that being feasible. If not, then this is simple a loss in functionality for many many subreddits.

So what, we're just homogenizing Reddit now? And I'm not talking about the visuals, but functionality.

I can never see one blanket "theme" system/style to cover *all* subreddits working as they used to.

CSS has accomplished:

* Functionality: /r/Overwatch has subreddit filters
* Functionality: /r/Dota2 has a list of current livestreams and their # of viewers
* UX: /r/videos has a list of rules where on hover it expands out to explain each rule
* Functionality: /r/Minecraft has a list of server status (icons) on sidebar
* UX: /r/Hearthstone has notices & links on the top banner
* Personality: /r/ffxiv has various [CSS Easter Eggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/50f41p/claps_for_the_moderators/?ref=search_posts) to give it a bit more personality
* Functionality: /r/Starcraft has a "verified user" system
* UX: /r/Guildwars2 increased the the size of "message the moderators" to make it stand out more
* UX: /r/ffxi has a small tooltip if a user hasn't set a user flair yet
* UX: /r/DarkSouls2 has related subreddits linked on the sidebar with images instead of text
* Personality: /r/mildlyinfuriating's joke where it slightly rotates "random" comment threads
* Functionality: /r/ClashOfClans not only has a list of livestreams, but thumbnail previews of each
* UX: /r/DarkSouls3 has a reminder when hovering over the downvote button
* Personality: /r/StarWars has quote popups when you upvote
* UX: /r/pcmasterrace has changed the "report" link to red
* UX: /r/explainlikeimfive has custom colored link flair icons
* Personality: /r/mylittlepony has countless emotes
* Personality: /r/onepiece has a scrolling banner (which can be paused)
* UX: /r/FinalFantasy has green background stickies to make them stand out
* Personality: /r/mildlyinteresting has a moving gauge on sidebar
* Functionality: /r/IASIP has a top menu
* UX: /r/DoctorWho has a light red box on sidebar for new users to read
* UX: /r/gallifrey disables the PM link on "Created by" so users focus on modmail

At the minimum, I see this as taking away the personality each subreddit has. We also lose the ability to control and improve UX, considering the admins have been exceptionally slow to improve any UX (even something like link flair).

To be clear, I'm not upset by the fact that the time we spent on our CSS is being made useless. I'm upset that we'll be losing functionality and *individual subreddit personality*.

[EDIT] Fellow mods, please remember to be civil here. I may not agree with this decision about CSS, but I still respect the admins and all the hard work they do.

<u/spez>: Just replying here so you know that I've seen it.

These are all great examples of cool stuff folks have done with CSS, and there are many more.

My goal today is to affirm that while CSS isn't the technology of the future for us, subreddit customization is important, and we're going to continue to evolve it.

I doubt I can convince you today with anything I say, but we're going to move forward, test carefully, and I hope you'll be a part of the process. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

Personally and from conversations I've had with other mods, it's been noticed and we're very appreciative of the changes and improvements that are evident.

CSS can go die in a fire, I have no love lost for leaving that behind. 

This sounds exciting, looking forward to it. I'd also like to commend you and your team for the increase in transparency and visibility over the last year or so. Things seem to be moving in a good direction, which makes it easier for mods to continue doing what they do.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.

<u/D0cR3d>: I like the thought of adding in toolbox and other mod tools, as well as the widgets, but I can't help but be worried that the widgets will be very limited and not replace the functionality many of us will be losing.

For instance our subreddit (gaming) likes to use countdown clocks to show how long until events (like game release, stream reveals), and use CSS to show a nice pretty image and styling for the countdown (bot that just edits sidebar description with time values counting down).

The lack of CSS styling gives me a uneasy fealing that our communities are turning away from something unique and special and just being another subreddit droid that all look basically the same. We've taken care to make sure our stylesheet works for as many users as we can based on what CSS can do, that it looks nice, and works great. Our users have complimented us on this and I just don't want to have our subreddit look exactly like everyone elses, just with our own banner and like 2 other images.

<u/spez>: We hear you, and have some of the same anxiety, which is why we're here now. Giving users a blank canvas has led to many wonderful developments on Reddit. This is not lost on us, and we'll work hard to continue to provide these surfaces for creativity.

We're thinking through a widget system to allow for the sort of functionality you're currently adding through CSS/markdown hacks.

<u/D0cR3d>: Thank you.

In another comment you said we'd get some more information over summer and go from there.

Our subreddid is based on the game Destiny and they are releasing a new game Sep 8th, and we wanted to have a new CSS to coincide with it.

You also said there would be a transition period. No one wants to waste time doing something just for it to be voided out shortly after. With this transition period before the cutoff date where old stylesheets will no longer work, would you say it'd still be a good investment to design a new CSS, or would you advise we scrap that and not do anything until we see what new styles we can apply? We'd like to have about 2-3 months for development, testing, etc.

Thank you,

<u/spez>: I would advice to continue developing until the new stuff is real. Who knows, maybe we'll screw it up and never release it... <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we‚Äôve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* It‚Äôs web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We‚Äôd love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: it‚Äôs difficult to learn; it‚Äôs error-prone; and it‚Äôs time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. We‚Äôd like to make changes more quickly. You‚Äôve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

We‚Äôre designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we‚Äôll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We‚Äôd like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? We‚Äôll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you‚Äôll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn‚Äôt going to be easy for everyone, so we‚Äôll assist communities that want help (i.e. we‚Äôll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

We‚Äôre in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we‚Äôll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don‚Äôt have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We‚Äôve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we‚Äôll keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorial‚Äìthankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we‚Äôll be grappling with together‚Äìchanges to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We‚Äôll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.

<u/Zackeezy116>: > but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign

Just to be clear, does this mean subreddits will lose their stylesheets?

<u/spez>: Stylesheets, yes. Styles, no. Does that make sense?

<u/itty53>: Not at all. 

Style sheets are just groups of styles. A style is

     .class { [rules] }

A style sheet is just a list of those, saved as a css file. 

As it stands, you allow stylesheets. Not individual styles. 

So I'm still confused here.

Sidenote, I think you are walking a razor wire over a bed of nails on this decision. Doing away with stylesheets affects a lot. That might just be a big enough shakeup to be comparable to digg changes. Just sayin'. Does not sound *good*.

<u/spez>: When I say Styles, I mean custom styling: images, colors, themes, menus. We're keeping the functionality, but changing the technology.

<u/spkr4thedead51>: what you're actually saying is that they will lose the styles until they learn the new technology and adapt their CSS stylesheets to the new technology

I assume that the new system will be made available ahead of time so that mods can test it and configure the new system prior to the deprecation of CSS on the live site?

<u/spez>: It will be available well in advance, yes. That's why we're here now.

We'll help with the transition for communities that want it. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

<u/spez>: No. It was awesome work, and we hope you continue to help your fellow mods.

Saying it was for nothing would be like saying all the work I and the team did on the current site was for nothing.

We should all be proud of what we've accomplished, but know that everything evolves over time.

<u/iNeverQuiteWas>: Yes but let's be honest here: you get paid for this, and I don't. My reward was seeing my work reach thousands of people. At the end of the day, you still have a site, users, etc., while my work is completely lost. I'm a little butt hurt I guess. 

<u/spez>: While I do get paid, I don't do it for the money.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we‚Äôll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We‚Äôd like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? We‚Äôll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you‚Äôll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn‚Äôt going to be easy for everyone, so we‚Äôll assist communities that want help (i.e. we‚Äôll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

We‚Äôre in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we‚Äôll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don‚Äôt have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We‚Äôve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we‚Äôll keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorial‚Äìthankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we‚Äôll be grappling with together‚Äìchanges to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We‚Äôll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.

<u/D0cR3d>: I like the thought of adding in toolbox and other mod tools, as well as the widgets, but I can't help but be worried that the widgets will be very limited and not replace the functionality many of us will be losing.

For instance our subreddit (gaming) likes to use countdown clocks to show how long until events (like game release, stream reveals), and use CSS to show a nice pretty image and styling for the countdown (bot that just edits sidebar description with time values counting down).

The lack of CSS styling gives me a uneasy fealing that our communities are turning away from something unique and special and just being another subreddit droid that all look basically the same. We've taken care to make sure our stylesheet works for as many users as we can based on what CSS can do, that it looks nice, and works great. Our users have complimented us on this and I just don't want to have our subreddit look exactly like everyone elses, just with our own banner and like 2 other images.

<u/spez>: We hear you, and have some of the same anxiety, which is why we're here now. Giving users a blank canvas has led to many wonderful developments on Reddit. This is not lost on us, and we'll work hard to continue to provide these surfaces for creativity.

We're thinking through a widget system to allow for the sort of functionality you're currently adding through CSS/markdown hacks. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned we‚Äôre currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we‚Äôve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* It‚Äôs web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We‚Äôd love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: it‚Äôs difficult to learn; it‚Äôs error-prone; and it‚Äôs time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. We‚Äôd like to make changes more quickly. You‚Äôve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

We‚Äôre designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we‚Äôll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

<u/Zackeezy116>: > but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign

Just to be clear, does this mean subreddits will lose their stylesheets?

<u/spez>: Stylesheets, yes. Styles, no. Does that make sense?

<u/itty53>: Not at all. 

Style sheets are just groups of styles. A style is

     .class { [rules] }

A style sheet is just a list of those, saved as a css file. 

As it stands, you allow stylesheets. Not individual styles. 

So I'm still confused here.

Sidenote, I think you are walking a razor wire over a bed of nails on this decision. Doing away with stylesheets affects a lot. That might just be a big enough shakeup to be comparable to digg changes. Just sayin'. Does not sound *good*.

<u/spez>: When I say Styles, I mean custom styling: images, colors, themes, menus. We're keeping the functionality, but changing the technology. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

<u/justjanne>: How about, instead of replacing, you could allow subreddits to keep using the old system for PC users for a few months?

This would make it easier to compare, test, find out what is missing, etc.

So that by the time the change becomes mandatory, all features will be there?

That's super rad, but will mobile users be able to see any of those things? A major pain point is that mobile users don't know how to use their apps properly and ignore sidebars. There was a mention of a pop-up of subreddit rules when mobile users visited a sub but that was a few weeks ago and I haven't seen anything since then.

Kinda pointless to pimp out your sidebar when half your users are too ignorant to find it.

<u/spez>: Yes. Bringing styles and as much of sidebar functionality as possible to mobile is an explicit goal of this project. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned we‚Äôre currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we‚Äôve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* It‚Äôs web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We‚Äôd love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: it‚Äôs difficult to learn; it‚Äôs error-prone; and it‚Äôs time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. We‚Äôd like to make changes more quickly. You‚Äôve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

We‚Äôre designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we‚Äôll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We‚Äôd like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? We‚Äôll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you‚Äôll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn‚Äôt going to be easy for everyone, so we‚Äôll assist communities that want help (i.e. we‚Äôll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

<u/adeadhead>: So wait, Reddit customization is being ruined in favor of toolbox support? I'm not sure how I feel about this. Mobile support only works with the fairly feature bare official Reddit app, which doesn't really support mod features anyway. 

What about subs like /r/Sweden who have a sidebar map with working links to subreddits in them? This sounds like a step in the wrong direction. 


Sincerely, a mod of pics, the subreddit with CSS that no one notices.  


Edit: as an actual question, will the final product be closer to selectable themes or selectable elements to add to our subreddit style, Scratch style. 

<u/spez>: We're redesigning the site, which means the DOM (the underlying structure of the site) is going to change, which would break CSS and mod tools if we did nothing. What I'm explaining here is what we're going to do about it:

* provide a new system of styling that isn't married to the DOM
* provide hooks into Reddit for mod tools that is less brittle <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

I'm not even remotely technically literate, so can I ask what this means? Are you replacing CSS with something else?

Indeed, great job admins  
  


<u/spez>: Yes, we're replacing CSS with a set of tools for customizing the appearance of your subreddit.

<u/honestbleeps>: I, for one, welcome a decent theming system over the free for all that CSS is, but that's going to be an unpopular opinion and a lot of people are going to be angry and upset, especially those who've spent a ton of time on their themes.

flair will be important to manage well. it is a giant hack and a ton of work with sprite sheets etc - but it's an integral part of a lot of subs.  I think this one will be really important to ensure you have day 1 even though it's probably a complex one to implement.

<u/spez>: The effort spent on CSS wasn't in vain. It's what got us here. Now we'll make it easier.

We're going to support flair as a first-class citizen. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

<u/Meepster23>: This single biggest thing you could do to support third party mod tools would be to add global window events / messages for certain actions so that addons could react to them more easily. This is especially true when doing things with the new modmail because it is all react based and trying to hook stuff up in the DOM is a royal pain the butt.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours.

<u/Baldemoto>: I have been wondering, what is the ultimate goal for this? 

Is it to make Reddit easier to navigate and make more accessible?

Is it to make Reddit more inviting to new users? 



Or maybe it's to make Reddit look like the new Modmail or Reddit mobile?

What is the ultimate goal here?

<u/spez>: There are multiple reasons:

* Yes, make it easier to use generally
* Yes, more inviting to new users
* Increase developer speed. Rewrites are a last resort, but Reddit runs on a lot of old code, and development in the current code base is painfully slow. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/modnews>: The web redesign, CSS, and mod tools

Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned we‚Äôre currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, we‚Äôve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* It‚Äôs web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. We‚Äôd love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: it‚Äôs difficult to learn; it‚Äôs error-prone; and it‚Äôs time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. We‚Äôd like to make changes more quickly. You‚Äôve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

We‚Äôre designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options we‚Äôll provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. We‚Äôd like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? We‚Äôll be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping you‚Äôll help us add and refine even more. The transition isn‚Äôt going to be easy for everyone, so we‚Äôll assist communities that want help (i.e. we‚Äôll do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

We‚Äôre in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, we‚Äôll begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we don‚Äôt have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. We‚Äôve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and we‚Äôll keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorial‚Äìthankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that we‚Äôll be grappling with together‚Äìchanges to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. We‚Äôll be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

<u/Zackeezy116>: > but we‚Äôll be deprecating CSS during the redesign

Just to be clear, does this mean subreddits will lose their stylesheets?

<u/spez>: Stylesheets, yes. Styles, no. Does that make sense? <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/cscareerquestions>: Upcoming AMA Announcement - Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman (aka u/Spez) April 24th

We hit 100K readers this week and I'd hoped we could do something big to commemorate the occasion. After a little [back and forth](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/853038610869866497) with u/kn0thing (co-founder Alexis Ohanian) on Twitter and some arrangements with Reddit's PR team, we can now announce that Reddit co-founder Steve Huffman (u/Spez) will be doing an AMA with us on Monday April 24th at 4PM EDT / 1PM PDT. And he's already [verified](http://imgur.com/JNyzBwJ) with a bit of current events humor.

Internships for everybody?? Please keep it classy.


This from Spez
Hello r/cscareerquestions, I‚Äôm Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid and in high school and college at Virginia (CS major), I worked as a developer. As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad you‚Äôre on Reddit! Oh, and, we‚Äôre hiring...

https://about.reddit.com/careers/  


<u/darexinfinity>: You do say reddit is hiring, but we hear that all the time. Companies that say this usually mean that they're passively hiring the same way an engineer will say "I'm keeping my eyes out for opportunities" even though some may not go anywhere at all. 

Is Reddit passively hiring or actively hiring? By active, I mean going through an expansion and have to fill-in those positions by a certain deadline.

<u/spez>: In advance of Monday, yes, we are actively [hiring!](https://www.reddit.com/jobs) Pretty much any sort of engineer. Yes, in San Francisco.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/me_irl>: me_irl

<u/spez>: As per our totally authentic announcement, everyone who upvoted this thread gets a little Gold.

update: this offer expired 3 months ago. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.

Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit‚Äôs commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook‚Äôs arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (‚ÄúKnight‚Äù) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court‚Äôs order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230‚Äôs immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

I‚Äôll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can‚Äôt always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

<u/iamastrange1oop>: What is Reddit's official position on providing user data to advertisers and other data aggregators?  

What type of data and methods of data collection are considered fair game, and which are currently in use?

<u/spez>: We don't share individual browsing habits with advertisers. You can read the full details in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/).

<u/Th3Reallegend>: Awesome

<u/LegenW84ITdary>: He said browsing habits, there is still a lot of information they have besides that. Email, location, device ID....

<u/spez>: We don't share any individually-identifying PII, such as emails, but we do allow advertisers to target based on location. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.

<u/spez>: I mention this elsewhere, but part of our strategy has been to store as little as possible to minimize surface area.

<u/BellyandKen>: /u/spez, thanks for posting this! 

A question on the requests for user account information:
The number of requests went up from 98 requests to 170, which is quite a jump. Why is it that these numbers increased so much from the previous year? I know Reddit is growing in users but is it that much or are sites like Reddit being used as evidence more in court cases?

Out of curiosity, is there any reason why so few of the requests for user account information from foreign countries were denied? (Not that I am complaining at all! I like that the number is so low)

Of the 234 million users of this website, it is quite impressive that only around 300 requests came in. Do you expect these requests to continue rising over the years?

What can we as users do or know to have a better peace of mind when it comes to our privacy on Reddit? (Not necessarily looking for advice on VPNs or the other wonderful info available at /r/privacy )

Thanks again for the transparency and answering any questions you can! Have a great day!

<u/spez>: Yes, I expect the number to continue to grow.

For context, check out the scale of [Google's report](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/).

> What can we as users do or know to have a better peace of mind when it comes to our privacy on Reddit?

We only know what you tell us, and we deliberately ask for little. IP addresses, which are a little harder for you to control, we only store for 100 days.

When it comes to privacy, I do believe there is some amount of personal responsibility and education required, but we try to be helpful where we can. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.

<u/-eDgAR->: Any update on 2FA for accounts? This whole talk about privacy reminded me I haven't heard anything in a while

<u/spez>: Yes, pretty sure it's on the roadmap for this quarter. Our focus the past couple of quarters has been to identify accounts that are likely to be taken over and protecting those (usually by issuing password resets).

<u/[deleted]>: Hey, sorry to rain on any parades, but as a mod of /r/help, we see a staggering number of people who get password reset emails that are already expired when they click them. You guys heard that? We get 1-3 reports of that a day which is a lot in /r/help

<u/spez>: Sure. We can always improve, but here are a few examples:

* We're dialing up our presence on r/modsupport
* Our goal is to keep ticket response times under 12 hours (our average is less than this)
* We just released the first version of [mod tools for mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/60w4x6/mod_tools_available_in_the_mobile_apps/)
* For big site features, e.g. the redesign, subreddit rules, post-to-profile, we work closely with mods during development

lol.

<u/spez>: > Emergency Disclosure Requests can be made to Reddit to compel us to disclose user account information in certain circumstances when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.

<u/[deleted]>: Since I'm working on making our monthly report for /r/pics now, have you seen the small reports we write up each month? I like these logs from reddit and hope reddit moderators like myself will start their own small scale efforts to increase transparency "At home"

edit: [link to our February report](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5wzu6m/february_2017_rpics_transparency_report/)

<u/spez>: Yep, I'm a fan. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.

Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit‚Äôs commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook‚Äôs arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (‚ÄúKnight‚Äù) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court‚Äôs order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230‚Äôs immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

I‚Äôll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can‚Äôt always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

<u/theflamesweregolfin>: If someone were to anonymously post the copyrighted recipe for mulan szechuan mcnugget sauce, and you received a request from the copyright holder to take it down, would you comply? 

<u/spez>: Yes, if it was a valid copyright request, that's what the DMCA requires. We could push back, but our appetite for defending you all has limits. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.

<u/orochi>: I know reddit admins sometimes take action (though they wont say what) when they encounter suicidal users on their platform.

I wish you would include when/if you notified authorities for those users in your transparency report. I think it would be beneficial to see that.

<u/spez>: What happens in these cases is we notify law enforcement and ask them to send a formal request. Those formal requests are counted in the report. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.

What type of data and methods of data collection are considered fair game, and which are currently in use?

<u/iNeverQuiteWas>: I have a question regarding the safeguards you have in place (generally speaking) when it comes to illegal content on Reddit. I'm not very fluent in the law, but are you a mandatory reporter in that, should illegal content be found on your site, you are responsible for reporting it to the appropriate authorities? If so, how do you go about handling that? Reddit is very large, so I'm assuming there would be automatic reporting? If this is the case, how do you reduce false positives? If not, how do you handle such a large load?

<u/spez>: > you are responsible for reporting it to the appropriate authorities?

It depends on the nature of the request. For something like child pornography, yes, we have to report. For something like how to make drugs, we don't. It doesn't mean we won't see a subpoena, though.

> If so, how do you reduce false positives? If not, how do you handle such a large load?

It's a lot of work, to be honest. We don't automatically do anything in this area. If it involves turning over information or removing content, we consider carefully. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/u_kn0thing>: The email I wrote u/spez from Singapore on July 11, 2004 that kicked off our entrepreneurial career together

I don't think I've ever used so many "bros" in my entire life, but here's the original email I sent Steve in all of its embarrassing glory. We started working on our original company, My Mobile Menu (MMM!) not long after I got back to the States that summer of our third year at UVA. That's "the pitch" I'm referring to below. Reddit came later. That's another post...

<u/spez>: Let's be clear: that pitch that was "one of the best he's heard," wasn't Reddit. Who knows what it could have been? Oh, well. There's always another train coming.

> i‚Äôm in singapore at this technepreneurial seminar, and am basically spending a week learning how to create a tech start-up.i spoke to Mark White (a professor in the comm school, the guy who took me to South Africa, and who recruited me to come here, as well as a generally good guy and technophile) over some drinks last nite, and pitched him on our idea‚Ä¶from his feedback‚Äìand let me remind you that he gets pitches every couple of months from students, and was very candid and honest with his thoughts, but basically said it was one of the best he‚Äôs heard, period.

> Not only that, but he wants to be on the board of directors, and already knows some people to hit up for starting capital‚Ä¶

> I‚Äôve got plenty of more details, but I am seriously considering putting off law school for this, but i need you, and we‚Äôll both need to be doing this full time for about a year to get it off the ground‚Ä¶.but the potential he saw was in the millions my friend‚Ä¶we need to talkseriously.i am coming back the 20th so if we could have lunch around 1pm i could meet you whereever you‚Äôd like‚Ä¶ let me know.

> honestly, this is the kind of thing that could change our lives‚Äìand his motivation has really spurred me.but i need you and the same kind of commitment.

<u/spez>: Let's be clear: that pitch that was "one of the best he's heard," wasn't Reddit. Who knows what it could have been? Oh, well. There's always another train coming. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

Hi Reddit!


Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You‚Äôll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We‚Äôre excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour‚Äôs new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he‚Äôs doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for ‚Äúshitty_watercolour‚Äù, ‚Äúkn0thing‚Äù, ‚Äúleagueoflegends‚Äù and you‚Äôll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we‚Äôre starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What‚Äôs next?
* We‚Äôre taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit‚Äôs existing communities, which is why we‚Äôre partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We‚Äôll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We‚Äôre testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They‚Äôll be able to post to their profile and you‚Äôll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (‚Äúalpha‚Äù) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we‚Äôre looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There‚Äôs no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that‚Äôs ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We‚Äôre specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere ‚Äî therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can‚Äôt succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We‚Äôre also testing a new feature called ‚ÄúActive in these Communities‚Äù on the tester‚Äôs profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we‚Äôre being so careful about how we‚Äôre testing this feature ‚Äî we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what‚Äôs the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature?**

A: We‚Äôre not making any changes to the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don‚Äôt want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I‚Äôm really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you‚Äôre wrong?**

A: We don‚Äôt have all of the answers right now and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we‚Äôre going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won‚Äôt know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We‚Äôll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We‚Äôre also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

<u/HikeTheSky>: Can you block stalkers or turn that function off?

<u/HideHideHidden>: Users will have the full toolset that moderators normally have for communities. You don't have to participate if you don't want to.

EDIT: Typo

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: We're going to try it out in a few admin comments. If it performs well will roll it out to a broader group.

<u/DavesWorldInfo>: This is going to pull people, both the individual posters (whether they're a company or a Youtuber or a random person who makes a thing that catches on) and the subreddit general users, into the profile posts.  And out of the subreddits.

Why would a game company, a creator, a whoever who has a thing that's gaining traction, want to post in a mere subreddit when they can focus all their posts on their profile page?  Where they have mod control by default?  Where they can tune and shape what they're doing.

What happens to various game subreddits when the developers, from small wanna-be indies all the way up to triple A devs and dev employees, stop posting in the subs and post only to their own profile?  What happens to new and upcoming creators, like binging with babbish or sovietwomble when they stop posting in threads about their vids and only post on their profiles?  Or when they only venture away from their profiles to link back to it?

Why would I talk about starcraft in /r/starcraft when I can talk about it on /u/blizzard and know they might be watching.  Because it's their channel?  That destroys /r/rts, /r/gaming, and so on.  The examples continue in the same fashion.

This changes Reddit, fundamentally.  It turns it into a clone of something it's not.  It removes what makes Reddit interesting and engaging; the collective gestalt of all the users rising and falling based on how they want things to go.

One of the default 'rules' of Reddit is "participate, don't promote."  How does profile centric posting help that?

And I say all this as a content creator.  If you guys push this change through, I'll use it for whatever it's worth.  While it lasts.  But me and a lot of other people will be looking for the next thing.  Making this change go live and wide sets a ticking clock on Reddit's destruction.

The community is what makes Reddit work.  Not power users, and certainly not companies showing up to big foot and massage and control their messages they way they do everywhere else in life.


<u/spez>: Thanks for your thoughts. While the scenario you paint is possible, I think it's the bleakest possible outcome, and one nobody wants to see happen. We still have plenty of work to do, and the feature will continue to evolve as we roll it out.

Instead of the total destruction of Reddit, what we'd like to accomplish is to make it easier for folks to find a place to share on Reddit.

Remember that time when u/GovSchwarzenegger wrote an op-ed for Reddit about marriage equality and then was immediately banned? That is so silly. Reddit is a place to share, discuss, and express yourself, and you should be able to do so without fear of immediately getting crushed. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

Hi Reddit!


Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You‚Äôll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We‚Äôre excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour‚Äôs new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he‚Äôs doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for ‚Äúshitty_watercolour‚Äù, ‚Äúkn0thing‚Äù, ‚Äúleagueoflegends‚Äù and you‚Äôll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we‚Äôre starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What‚Äôs next?
* We‚Äôre taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit‚Äôs existing communities, which is why we‚Äôre partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We‚Äôll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We‚Äôre testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They‚Äôll be able to post to their profile and you‚Äôll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (‚Äúalpha‚Äù) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we‚Äôre looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There‚Äôs no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that‚Äôs ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We‚Äôre specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere ‚Äî therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can‚Äôt succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We‚Äôre also testing a new feature called ‚ÄúActive in these Communities‚Äù on the tester‚Äôs profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we‚Äôre being so careful about how we‚Äôre testing this feature ‚Äî we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what‚Äôs the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature?**

A: We‚Äôre not making any changes to the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don‚Äôt want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I‚Äôm really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you‚Äôre wrong?**

A: We don‚Äôt have all of the answers right now and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we‚Äôre going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won‚Äôt know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We‚Äôll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We‚Äôre also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

<u/BobHogan>: Why are you trying to turn Reddit into a social media clone? 

I didn't get an answer yesterday, but I really want to know.

Edit - /u/HideHideHidden, /u/spez, /u/kn0thing, I really hope you guys are taking this feedback seriously. Don't just look at the number of upvotes on this announcement and decide its good to go. As it stands right now, its at a 50% approval rating from the community, and its been dropping fast. Last time I checked on this thread (about 3 hours ago) you guys were around 62-65% upvote, and about 5 hours ago it was in the 70s. This started out as a controversial idea, and as this has progressed, the proportion of people who have upvoted this announcement has steadily dropped lower.

Not to mention that the top comments in this thread are all about how this will either be bad or how actual Reddit users don't want this. Note that they are the highest comments in this  thread. These are the sentiments that your own users agree with the most. And collectively they have already obtained at least 21 gildings (only looking at the top 10 top level replies, not accounting for any gildings that may have happened in those threads), all about how people do not want this to come to Reddit.

I'm begging you guys to reconsider this heavily. This is not what your users want. A lot of us are feeling a bit betrayed, and you haven't given us a good reason as to why you went this route. You have several times now cited the difficulty in creating a personal subreddit to do exactly what you claim these user pages are for, so if that is one of the true focuses here, why did you not simply make that process easier? Reddit users, your users, are not happy about this change, and we do not want it to come to Reddit. We are, rightfully so, scared of the implications that such a change will bring later on. 

<u/HideHideHidden>: We're working on making it easier for content creators to find a home for their content on Reddit. In practice, this is very similar to a subreddit with one submitter but making the entire process a lot easier for our users.

<u/Luna_LoveWell>: I'm one of those people with my own eponymous subreddit (and the largest one for posting OC, as far as I know!) that you're targeting with this change, and I still do not understand the value that this adds *at all*. All I can see is that it takes *away* several features that I regularly use in my personal subreddit including:

1. Text in the sidebar with more information about me.

2. Sticky posts

3. Allowing other people to post in my subreddit with relevant content. 

4. Subreddit wiki


-----

As a content creator, what I *really* need from the admins is a better way to let readers out there know that I exist and where they can find my stuff (/r/Luna_Lovewell for all you readers out there!). That's what you should be working on, instead of duplicating what personal subreddits already offer.

<u/HideHideHidden>: We'll be adding in these features in time with the new profile experience. We want to enable more great content creators like you to be able to post to their own profile and a following. For content creators today, it's very challenging and we want to make that much easier. If you're happy with your current setup, we're not asking you to do anything different.

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: > you're claiming setting up a subreddit with posting privileges restricted to yourself is hard

It's totally hard, which is why few people do it. Yes, we do have other problems, including a clunky UI around some of this stuff, which we're working on. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

<u/[deleted]>:  I do have a few problems.

What if we dont want to be followed by people?

What if we dont want everyone to know we are active in certain subreddits especially NSFW ones?


I personally do not like the profile page as it feels weird. Like it is a forum or Facebook profile page. I am fine chatting with other strangers without knowing where they are active in other subreddits or the choice of following them. I dont like to keep it personal as I like reddit as a more of a community based site.

Also, even if we can make certain things private or make our profile private, there will be subreddits that will require you to have a public profile to participate in the sub.

<u/spez>: > What if we don't want to be followed by people?

Can you elaborate?

> What if we dont want everyone to know we are active in certain subreddits especially NSFW ones?

The user will have control over which communities are displayed, if any.

<u/[deleted]>: It is just that I get uncomfortable people following me as if they are stalking me on everything I post. I am not a sort of celebrity and I intend to remain that way. 

Another issue is if we can make certain things private or make our profile private, there will be subreddits that will require you to have a public profile or you have to display certain things in your profile to participate in the sub. 

<u/spez>: Presently, everything you post on Reddit is publicly accessible on your user page. This feature actually gives you more control for what get displayed there. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We‚Äôll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We‚Äôre also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

<u/BrahmsLullaby>: I'm not opposed and don't think it's "wrong", but from an initial impression I see some features and concepts that take away the uniqueness of Reddit and make it blend with a lot of other social media platforms.

I could just be overprotective of my nostalgia from Redditing for a while now (this account doesn't reflect how long I have been) - but this seems to put an emphasis on names, people, brands - where my enjoyment has come from a focus on content.

I didn't have a chance to type out all my thoughts, and I'm just as interested to see how this plays out, just food for thought. 


<u/spez>: What we really want to see is for users who have things to share, they have a place to put it. Even I have this problem. I often have ideas for a post, but don't know which community I should submit it to. r/announcements, my main home, probably isn't appropriate. Even if I know the right community, I may not know the community norms and rules. This gives me a place to put my thoughts without worry that I'm going to get insta-banned. If someone decides it's appropriate for their community, they can x-post it. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

Hi Reddit!


Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You‚Äôll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We‚Äôre excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour‚Äôs new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he‚Äôs doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for ‚Äúshitty_watercolour‚Äù, ‚Äúkn0thing‚Äù, ‚Äúleagueoflegends‚Äù and you‚Äôll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we‚Äôre starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What‚Äôs next?
* We‚Äôre taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit‚Äôs existing communities, which is why we‚Äôre partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We‚Äôll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We‚Äôre testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They‚Äôll be able to post to their profile and you‚Äôll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (‚Äúalpha‚Äù) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we‚Äôre looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There‚Äôs no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that‚Äôs ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We‚Äôre specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere ‚Äî therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can‚Äôt succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We‚Äôre also testing a new feature called ‚ÄúActive in these Communities‚Äù on the tester‚Äôs profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we‚Äôre being so careful about how we‚Äôre testing this feature ‚Äî we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what‚Äôs the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature?**

A: We‚Äôre not making any changes to the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don‚Äôt want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I‚Äôm really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you‚Äôre wrong?**

A: We don‚Äôt have all of the answers right now and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we‚Äôre going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won‚Äôt know until we try and put this front of our users.

<u/AllTheRowboats93>: I wonder if this will change the dynamic of the site. 

<u/Surinical>: A lot of people already have a subreddit dedicated to just them, so this already kind of exists.

<u/HideHideHidden>: We want to make the process of doing something like this much easier for our content creators.

<u/Ryltarr>: For these users who already have subreddits for their things will the posts be able to merge into their profile?  
I'm still not fond of the idea, but if the subreddit could be transformed into their profile that'd be a way to make the transition smoother.

<u/spez>: Depending on demand, that's a reasonable request. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

<u/ScanianMoose>: My questions were left unanswered yesterday, so let's try again:

How will you counteract [SEO spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamdexing)? 

Will you counteract SEO spam posted on user's profiles at all? 

How will I be able to get spam and prohibited content off this site, especially if it's time-sensitive? Since we're sidestepping automod rules and human moderation here, there does not seem to be an adequate solution to this. 

Your answers boil down to "let upvotes decide" and "spammers won't get many subs anyway", but we all know that this is not how this works. 

How will I be able to find OC creators if not by their real name? 

Will personal posts be included in the reddit-wide search (please no)?

Will we be able to differentiate between profile and subreddit posts i.e. will Toolbox still be able to compile an accurate report of submitted domain percentages (only subreddit posts)?

<u/spez>: > Will you counteract SEO spam posted on user's profiles at all?

We'll continue to fight spam wherever it is. We have made a lot of progress in the last year, reducing spam reports by over 90%. The vast majority of spam is not caught by automod or humans.

> How will I be able to find OC creators if not by their real name?

It's important to us that Reddit is useable without real names. Folks can choose to disclose this if they want, of course.

As for discoverability, a user's posts could be x-posted elsewhere, which is how Reddit works today, or the user may have their own community, which a handful already do now.

> Will personal posts be included in the reddit-wide search (please no)?

Search is getting a complete overhaul at the moment, so this will likely be an option.

> Will we be able to differentiate between profile and subreddit posts i.e. will Toolbox still be able to compile an accurate report of submitted domain percentages (only subreddit posts)?

That's up the toolbox devs, but it should be apparent which subreddits belong to a user and which are traditional communities.

e: punctuation <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

Hi Reddit!


Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You‚Äôll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We‚Äôre excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour‚Äôs new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he‚Äôs doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for ‚Äúshitty_watercolour‚Äù, ‚Äúkn0thing‚Äù, ‚Äúleagueoflegends‚Äù and you‚Äôll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we‚Äôre starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What‚Äôs next?
* We‚Äôre taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit‚Äôs existing communities, which is why we‚Äôre partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We‚Äôll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We‚Äôre testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They‚Äôll be able to post to their profile and you‚Äôll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (‚Äúalpha‚Äù) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we‚Äôre looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There‚Äôs no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that‚Äôs ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We‚Äôre specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere ‚Äî therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can‚Äôt succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We‚Äôre also testing a new feature called ‚ÄúActive in these Communities‚Äù on the tester‚Äôs profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we‚Äôre being so careful about how we‚Äôre testing this feature ‚Äî we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what‚Äôs the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature?**

A: We‚Äôre not making any changes to the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don‚Äôt want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I‚Äôm really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you‚Äôre wrong?**

A: We don‚Äôt have all of the answers right now and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we‚Äôre going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won‚Äôt know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We‚Äôll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We‚Äôre also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

<u/AllTheRowboats93>: I wonder if this will change the dynamic of the site. 

<u/HideHideHidden>: We're testing this carefully but the goal is to give a home for people to put their original content. We think more original content and content creators will spur more conversations throughout Reddit.

<u/BobRawrley>: Are we going to end up having default users, in addition to default subreddits?

<u/spez>: Nope <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

<u/HungJurror>: I can see people trying to (and maybe succeeding) become famous much like people have done on vine, twitter, and youtube. That might mean seeing the same several users' profile posts on the top of /r/all just about every day. Any chance we'll be able to filter certain user posts out of /r/all? My filter has no room to add any more, but I'd sacrifice a few filtered subs to keep from seeing the same person's blog every day


I do like this change though

<u/[deleted]>:  I do have a few problems.

What if we dont want to be followed by people?

What if we dont want everyone to know we are active in certain subreddits especially NSFW ones?


I personally do not like the profile page as it feels weird. Like it is a forum or Facebook profile page. I am fine chatting with other strangers without knowing where they are active in other subreddits or the choice of following them. I dont like to keep it personal as I like reddit as a more of a community based site.

Also, even if we can make certain things private or make our profile private, there will be subreddits that will require you to have a public profile to participate in the sub.

<u/spez>: > What if we don't want to be followed by people?

Can you elaborate?

> What if we dont want everyone to know we are active in certain subreddits especially NSFW ones?

The user will have control over which communities are displayed, if any. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TL;DR: Today we're testing out a new feature that will allow users to post directly to their profile

* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What‚Äôs next?
* We‚Äôre taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit‚Äôs existing communities, which is why we‚Äôre partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We‚Äôll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We‚Äôre testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They‚Äôll be able to post to their profile and you‚Äôll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (‚Äúalpha‚Äù) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we‚Äôre looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There‚Äôs no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that‚Äôs ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We‚Äôre specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere ‚Äî therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can‚Äôt succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We‚Äôre also testing a new feature called ‚ÄúActive in these Communities‚Äù on the tester‚Äôs profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we‚Äôre being so careful about how we‚Äôre testing this feature ‚Äî we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

---

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what‚Äôs the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature?**

A: We‚Äôre not making any changes to the existing ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don‚Äôt want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I‚Äôm really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you‚Äôre wrong?**

A: We don‚Äôt have all of the answers right now and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we‚Äôre going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won‚Äôt know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We‚Äôll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We‚Äôre also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

<u/MajorParadox>: It looks pretty cool!  How do the users manage them, though?  Are they provided the same tools they get for a subreddit?

<u/spez>: Yep. The feature is built on top of the existing subreddit system. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago‚Äîespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven‚Äôt given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

<u/cggreene2>: Please remember why the current reddit site is the way it is. It is functional not pretty. If making it look good comes at thr expense of making the site more difficult to navigate, do not do it!

<u/spez>: The goal is make it better. Don't worry, many of the world's most dedicate redditors work here. We love it as much or more than you.

<u/funderbunk>: Given the track record of some of the decisions of the past (I've lost track of how many *"We're taking steps to make sure it never happens again"* posts I've seen), pardon me if I'm not terribly optimistic. 

<u/spez>: In that case, I feel confident that we will exceed your expectations.

<u/funderbunk>: So many times when my expectations were low and I thought, "They can't possibly fuck this up *that* badly", it turned out that whoever I was giving the benefit of the doubt rose to the occasion and fucked it up even worse.

<u/[deleted]>: 1. Do you guys check out /r/ideasfortheadmins? There are quite a few great ideas that you could choose from there to introduce to reddit  
2. What is the process to get subs that blatantly violate [reddit's involuntary pornography rules](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205704725-What-is-involuntary-pornography-and-glorification-of-sexual-violence-) banned or atleast have an admin look at them?   
3. I wish the /r/communitydialogue project gets started again. There are quite a lot of things moderators wish to discuss with the admins like /u/achievementunlockd. I hope you're able to allocate more resources to this subreddit. Two particular areas of concern for me anyway is how to deal with spam that is not caught by the spambot at /r/spam, and how to better deal with ban evaders.  
4. Why do admins mod hate subs like /r/onionhate? They ban innocent users from /r/OnionLovers   
5. Can we have better traffic stats for subreddits? The existing stats exclude mobile traffic and are not very indepth. 

<u/spez>: 1. Yes. The limiting factor for improvements isn't ideas, it's our ancient codebase and hesitation to break things like RES and custom styles. In that respect, I feel like we've been held hostage from a development point of view (Stockholm syndrome?). That's why we're so excited to rewrite desktop web. It's going to be a doozy, but worth it in the end.

2. Please send to contact@reddit.com

3. Yes. I'll follow up there. I know it got a little derailed with Spezgiving and the holidays.

4. If u/sodypop says so, that's the way it is 

<u/awkwardtheturtle>: Important follow up question regarding Question 4:

How do **you** feel about onions? Are they:

- a.) An acceptable ingredient that while is not terribly important to a meal, detracts little

- b.) Literally the bee's knees and they should be present in every dish

- c.) Literally the Devil's root vegetable. They're a scourge on this earth, a wretched and inferior filler ingredient, and an abomination to the very idea of culinary greatness

We appreciate your answer. Please keep in mind that only one of these answers could result in the esteemed and remarkable reward of being made a moderator at /r/OnionHate.

Have a nice day. 


<u/spez>: I have three tiers of food dislike.

Tier 1: I hate them. I will spit them out. Olives.

Tier 2: I don't like them, but will get it down to be polite. Eggplant.

Tier 3: I don't like them, but I wish I did, and I'm trying. Tomatoes, Mushrooms. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago‚Äîespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven‚Äôt given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times.

<u/cleantoe>: I hear [you're preparing for the apocalypse](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich). But what about Reddit? What are your plans to make sure Reddit stays up and running during these next 4 years?

Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

<u/cggreene2>: Please remember why the current reddit site is the way it is. It is functional not pretty. If making it look good comes at thr expense of making the site more difficult to navigate, do not do it!

<u/spez>: The goal is make it better. Don't worry, many of the world's most dedicate redditors work here. We love it as much or more than you.

<u/funderbunk>: Given the track record of some of the decisions of the past (I've lost track of how many *"We're taking steps to make sure it never happens again"* posts I've seen), pardon me if I'm not terribly optimistic.

<u/RiceOnTheRun>: New website?

I feel like the current Reddit UI is so iconic I don't even know how else I'd picutre it

<u/spez>: I'd like the new version to feel like a Rolls Royce: it feels classic, but is actually modern.

The current version is more like a Chevy Vega.

<u/[deleted]>: Is there another example of this "Rolls Royce" that already exists, or something similar to it? Just trying to picture how it could change.

<u/spez>: I hear you. The designs aren't finalized, we're mostly focused on the tech at the moment.

I would like to share an interesting learning. Since the beginning of Reddit, our product design philosophy has been to cram as much content into view as possible, our thinking being that it increases the odds that a user will see something they like. In our native mobile apps, we use a card view, which basically shows one piece of content at a time. Interestingly enough, engagement in the native apps is approximately 4x higher than the desktop.

I see this in my own usage as well. I go through a ton more content on mobile than I do on desktop. This could be because everything is pre-expanded or because the apps have infinite scroll. We'll test these things thoroughly before deploying to a wide audience, of course, but it goes to show that our intuition isn't always correct.

<u/spez>: I do see this problem. In fact, we've had a lot more success the past few months going after bad users instead of punishing the communities they frequent.

It's a lot easier to do so if we have the support of the mods of the relevant communities.

<u/[deleted]>: What do you guys think of the mods that use a bot to detect when a user posts on a sub they don't like and then bans them from their own sub when most of the time that user hasn't broken any rules in their sub or even participated in it?

<u/spez>: I don't like it, but I also know sometimes it's necessary. There are a handful of things like this (e.g. auto-banning, shadow-banning) that I'd like to get rid of, but if we do so without providing a better alternative, we'd cause a lot of trouble. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago‚Äîespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven‚Äôt given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

Here's to a happy, productive, drama-free (ha), 2017!

<u/SpaceMasters>: How can reddit avoid the same fate as Digg after their desktop site update?

<u/spez>: By testing carefully and being considerate to our users. The biggest mistake Digg made was they couldn't undo the change, or didn't want to, or just didn't.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

<u/RiceOnTheRun>: New website?

I feel like the current Reddit UI is so iconic I don't even know how else I'd picutre it

<u/spez>: I'd like the new version to feel like a Rolls Royce: it feels classic, but is actually modern.

The current version is more like a Chevy Vega. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

<u/[deleted]>: 1. Do you guys check out /r/ideasfortheadmins? There are quite a few great ideas that you could choose from there to introduce to reddit  
2. What is the process to get subs that blatantly violate [reddit's involuntary pornography rules](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205704725-What-is-involuntary-pornography-and-glorification-of-sexual-violence-) banned or atleast have an admin look at them?   
3. I wish the /r/communitydialogue project gets started again. There are quite a lot of things moderators wish to discuss with the admins like /u/achievementunlockd. I hope you're able to allocate more resources to this subreddit. Two particular areas of concern for me anyway is how to deal with spam that is not caught by the spambot at /r/spam, and how to better deal with ban evaders.  
4. Why do admins mod hate subs like /r/onionhate? They ban innocent users from /r/OnionLovers   
5. Can we have better traffic stats for subreddits? The existing stats exclude mobile traffic and are not very indepth. 

<u/spez>: 1. Yes. The limiting factor for improvements isn't ideas, it's our ancient codebase and hesitation to break things like RES and custom styles. In that respect, I feel like we've been held hostage from a development point of view (Stockholm syndrome?). That's why we're so excited to rewrite desktop web. It's going to be a doozy, but worth it in the end.

2. Please send to contact@reddit.com

3. Yes. I'll follow up there. I know it got a little derailed with Spezgiving and the holidays.

4. If u/sodypop says so, that's the way it is 

<u/[deleted]>: >I feel like we've been held hostage from a development point of view 

Does this mean reddit will prioritize utility over design? Because current proto reddit 2.0 designs are pretty but lacking entirely a lot of functionality. On mobile this may work out, but your power users are on desktop. How will you tackle that?

<u/spez>: We test everything carefully. One of the major efforts of 2016 was both building the testing framework and the culture of experimentation. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

<u/[deleted]>: So we know the Geek Squad gets $$ working as FBI Informants.. WHAT ARE YOU GETTING SPAZ???

<u/spez>: Karma, baby. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago‚Äîespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven‚Äôt given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

<u/Sambo13>: Could you share the stats on image hosting? I'd be really interested to see how Reddits own platform has taken over imgur in a relatively short time frame.
Keep up the great work!

<u/spez>: More than 50% of the uploads are to us now. This is encouraging because we didn't really promote the feature, and the flow could be a lot better (and it will get a lot better). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

<u/raldi>: How big a problem is ban evasion? Every time I've [messaged the admins](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&subject=Ban%20Evasion) about a suspected case, it's always been quickly resolved, but I'm curious whether it's whack-a-mole or if the Anti-Evil team is building a robot army to automatically eradicate it as part of their 2017 OKRs.

Edit, since all the replies except spez appear to have misread my comment: I'm asking about ban **evasion**, not ban abuse. As in, people who get banned and then immediately make a new sockpuppet to continue their trolling. 

<u/spez>: A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

As you know, solve it once by hand. Solve it twice by hand. If it's still a problem, automate it. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

Will you guys work more on the image/gif hosting side of reddit? For example, some gifs are so raw that it takes forever to download. And the urls, oh god, they go on for miles.

Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago‚Äîespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven‚Äôt given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse.

<u/Non_Player-Character>: I'm liking the increase of these 'what's happening' announcement posts. Keep up the great work!

40% of views from apps is surprising to me! Might have to check them out. 

Also, first time hearing of this rework. I think a lot of reddit's charm is the relative plainness of the website, although I don't know enough about code to tell how the backend works. Is this a functional change, visual rework or just a complete overhaul of everything?

<u/spez>: I agree re charm. We don't have to lose that feeling to make things better.

Reddit still runs code that I wrote ~~ten~~ twelve years ago when I was 21. I really hope by the end of this year most of that trash is gone!

<u/spez>: I hear you. The designs aren't finalized, we're mostly focused on the tech at the moment.

I would like to share an interesting learning. Since the beginning of Reddit, our product design philosophy has been to cram as much content into view as possible, our thinking being that it increases the odds that a user will see something they like. In our native mobile apps, we use a card view, which basically shows one piece of content at a time. Interestingly enough, engagement in the native apps is approximately 4x higher than the desktop.

I see this in my own usage as well. I go through a ton more content on mobile than I do on desktop. This could be because everything is pre-expanded or because the apps have infinite scroll. We'll test these things thoroughly before deploying to a wide audience, of course, but it goes to show that our intuition isn't always correct. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made.

<u/rt4nyp>: Please don't make the rewrite of the desktop site result in a Digg 2 fiasco

Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago‚Äîespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven‚Äôt given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

<u/RunHanRun>: Can we get "sort by rising" in the iOS app? I need to view Reddit in as many different ways possible during my work bathroom trips.

<u/spez>: Perhaps, but one of the things we'd like to achieve with a new frontpage algo is to no longer require new and rising. The goal would be for every post to get enough view to have a fair chance.

<u/[deleted]>: 1. Do you guys check out /r/ideasfortheadmins? There are quite a few great ideas that you could choose from there to introduce to reddit  
2. What is the process to get subs that blatantly violate [reddit's involuntary pornography rules](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205704725-What-is-involuntary-pornography-and-glorification-of-sexual-violence-) banned or atleast have an admin look at them?   
3. I wish the /r/communitydialogue project gets started again. There are quite a lot of things moderators wish to discuss with the admins like /u/achievementunlockd. I hope you're able to allocate more resources to this subreddit. Two particular areas of concern for me anyway is how to deal with spam that is not caught by the spambot at /r/spam, and how to better deal with ban evaders.  
4. Why do admins mod hate subs like /r/onionhate? They ban innocent users from /r/OnionLovers   
5. Can we have better traffic stats for subreddits? The existing stats exclude mobile traffic and are not very indepth. 

<u/spez>: 1. Yes. The limiting factor for improvements isn't ideas, it's our ancient codebase and hesitation to break things like RES and custom styles. In that respect, I feel like we've been held hostage from a development point of view (Stockholm syndrome?). That's why we're so excited to rewrite desktop web. It's going to be a doozy, but worth it in the end.

2. Please send to contact@reddit.com

3. Yes. I'll follow up there. I know it got a little derailed with Spezgiving and the holidays.

4. If u/sodypop says so, that's the way it is  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Out with 2016, in with 2017

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. Will check back in a couple hours. Thanks!


<u/tikotanabi>: The admins of Reddit did a great job of pushing out updates in 2016 that benefit the community. Thanks for the hard work you guys have put in and thanks for listening to the feedback and suggestions many of us have given you. 

<u/spez>: Thank you! I know the team loves hearing this as well.

2017 should be a fun year. Every day our pace gets a little bit faster. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/bestof>: Ellen Pao responds to spez in the admin announcement

<u/ekjp>: The difference between an engineer that turned CEO and [an engineer](http://imgur.com/a/9jZnE) turned lawyer turned CEO. FTFY

<u/spez>: TIL.

The other part of my comment still stands: you weren't dumb enough to do something like this. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

**tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm sorry. I won‚Äôt do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line‚Äîup to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

<u/jaspersnutts>: As a subscriber to r/the_donald I would love it if you did work to reprimand the people spreading the message of hate, racism, bigotry, homophobia, etc.. 

The actions of the few should not generalize all of us. The vast majority of us welcome anyone no matter what race, gender, religion you belong to. We didn't want to make america great again for half the country. We want to make it great for everyone. 

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the gold! MAGA!

<u/spez>: I agree entirely with this sentiment. This message needs to come from your moderators. If it does, the community has a chance. If it does not, r/the_donald is trending in the wrong direction. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

<u/CaptInsane>: How do you feel about [ArsTechnica's David Kravets](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/11/reddit-chief-admits-to-editing-comments-that-were-critical-of-him/) comparing you to Ellen Pao, and that despite all the hate she got she didn't stoop this low?

> Even Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, didn't change comments despite a barrage of insults levied at her last year as the site began cleaning up its community.

<u/spez>: It's fair. Ellen wasn't the first Reddit engineer, so she probably lacked the expertise to do it, and even if she did, she was smart enough to not.

u: Since this is blowing up, let me clarify. Ellen wasn't an engineer, so she probably lacked access, and if she did have access, she wouldn't have done this. I have said many times I thought the way she was treated on Reddit was despicable. The changes we made to r/all earlier this summer would have mitigated some of the harassment, and I regret we didn't make those changes years ago. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

<u/78952497829864>: Hi spez,

Related to the editing incident and trust, in [this article in New York Magazine](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/reddit-founder-steve-huffman.html), it says:

> After leaving, Huffman found that he had a hard time letting go. He still had administrative access to the site and continued tinkering with its code. Once that access was cut off, he found a back door for another six months before finally being locked out.

Am I correct that this means you could still do things like edit users' posts, view their private data (including private messages and subreddits), shadowban users, etc. for a long period of time **while not even working at reddit any more?**

If that is true, it's extremely alarming and raises a lot of questions, including:

* Why did you need administrative access after quitting?
* What supervision was there of a non-employee with admin access?
* Have there been other non-employees with admin access? Are there any right now?
* How was it acceptable (or even legal) to use "a back door" to take back privileged access that the company clearly didn't want you to have?

<u/spez>: > Why did you need administrative access after quitting?

When I left, Reddit was six people, and I had the majority of the engineering knowledge, so I continued to help out even after I left.

> What supervision was there of a non-employee with admin access?

There were six of us, and we were all close friends. My actions were limited to quick fixes here and there.

> Have there been other non-employees with admin access? Are there any right now?

No, that was disabled long ago. A few notable ex-employees have distinguish mode in recognition of their contributions to Reddit.

> How was it acceptable (or even legal) to use "a back door" to take back privileged access that the company clearly didn't want you to have?

That's just bad reporting. Someone made a patch to remove my access. I made a patch to add it back. Nothing was done in secret. This was back in 2010. My access was removed sometime in 2010 when Reddit and I had fully separated. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

<u/SaulJoker>: Imma take this opportunity to ask you something /u/spez

i'd really like a way for me to find new subreddits on my frontpage without having to find a popular post or comment on /r/all or having to dig for it. Especially the smaller, niche communities.

Have you ever though of adding a recommended subreddits tab somewhere? There definitely isn't one on the mobile app and I dont think there is one on the website.

EDIT: Some people are mentioning www.reddit.com/explore . If only I had known about this sooner (but to be honest doesn't really "satisfy" my concern, as nice as it is). I already found a (hopefully) [interesting community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModeratelyConfused/)

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line‚Äîup to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

<u/[deleted]>: /u/spez, most users possessing even a modicum of common sense forgive you for snapping and deciding to troll the trolls. You're only human and reddit's mantra has always been "remember the human".  
  
We're sorry the admins, yourself included, had a miserable thanksgiving.  
  
I have a follow up question: does this new sticky-post behavior only impact /r/The_Donald or its affiliate subs as well?  



<u/spez>: Right now, just them.

In the past, when a community was deliberately wasting our time, we would look for general solutions that wouldn't single out a specific community. Unfortunately, that usually causes civilian casualties (e.g. when we removed all stickies from r/all and broke sports communities).

Going forward, we'll just take away their toys specifically and move on. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

<u/i_am_not_sam>: * Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know?

* Has this ever happened before?

* Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit?

edit: (from me, not /u/spez. Really)

I'm glad you saw it to apologize. I was in the "so fucking what"/"it was just a small edit" camp but I can see why some people would be so angry about it. It was poor judgement and you put yourself in a lose-lose situation. That said, most of us will still use the site as before because I honestly can't think of any other content aggregator like this one.

I'm also glad you guys finally got around to implementing the sub-reddit blocking feature. I'd done that with RES a long time and I truly didn't understand why people were so bent out of shape over /r/the_donald. If the charges about "doxxing, harassment" etc. are true (and I can see it happening) then the questions to ask are

* is the sub responsible for it? If yes, then what do reddit's policies say about this behavior?

* if the sub isn't responsible then how are you 
 * evaluating the truth in this accusation
 * taking action to protect reddit from other websites and social media
 * planning to prevent something like this (power user getting harassed to the point of doing something extremely silly/unprofessional) from every happening again?

<u/spez>: > Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know?

No. Only engineers with access to production data, and that is being limited.

> Has this ever happened before?

In 2009 I replaced the word "fag" with "fog". Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default.

This whole experience has been pretty painful. Even with the best of intentions, I (we) won't do this again.

> Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit?

The clear cut policies are in our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).


<u/Jaciola>: >Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default.

Question for you. I understand the reason for not editing titles is to not have people create popular posts and then change the title to something inflammatory.

However, why not allow a small 5 minute window to change the title? It shouldn't be long enough to blow up but may be long enough to help prevent a typo 

<u/spez>: > However, why not allow a small 5 minute window to change the title? It shouldn't be long enough to blow up but may be long enough to help prevent a typo

Totally reasonable. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line‚Äîup to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

Why not all subreddits? If this behaviour is toxic why not block it completely? Other subs could exploit it.

<u/spez>: Because most communities use it for good. For example, sports communities for game threads and TV communities for episodes. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

<u/i_am_not_sam>: * Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know?

* Has this ever happened before?

* Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit?

edit: (from me, not /u/spez. Really)

I'm glad you saw it to apologize. I was in the "so fucking what"/"it was just a small edit" camp but I can see why some people would be so angry about it. It was poor judgement and you put yourself in a lose-lose situation. That said, most of us will still use the site as before because I honestly can't think of any other content aggregator like this one.

I'm also glad you guys finally got around to implementing the sub-reddit blocking feature. I'd done that with RES a long time and I truly didn't understand why people were so bent out of shape over /r/the_donald. If the charges about "doxxing, harassment" etc. are true (and I can see it happening) then the questions to ask are

* is the sub responsible for it? If yes, then what do reddit's policies say about this behavior?

* if the sub isn't responsible then how are you 
 * evaluating the truth in this accusation
 * taking action to protect reddit from other websites and social media
 * planning to prevent something like this (power user getting harassed to the point of doing something extremely silly/unprofessional) from every happening again?

<u/spez>: > Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know?

No. Only engineers with access to production data, and that is being limited.

> Has this ever happened before?

In 2009 I replaced the word "fag" with "fog". Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default.

This whole experience has been pretty painful. Even with the best of intentions, I (we) won't do this again.

> Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit?

The clear cut policies are in our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).


<u/optimalg>: >Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default.

You mean I could have just messaged you everytime I fucked up a title, instead of running into the timer after deleting and reposting? Dangit, all that karmawhoring potential over the years is gone. 

<u/spez>: And now it's really gone. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line‚Äîup to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

PS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&fm=mp4&mp4-fragmented=false&s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I‚Äôm old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.


<u/panthera_tigress>: So do you still have the ability to ninja edit anyone's post, or is that not a thing reddit admins can do anymore?

Because I think that should be a thing that reddit admins literally cannot do.

Edit: by this I mean that admins/engineers/whatever shouldn't be able to edit without it being marked, not that they shouldn't be able to edit at all. I understand that it's not possible for the latter to happen.

<u/spez>: admins (employees) can't do this in general. It's because I had access to everything as an engineer, which we are limiting going forward. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: TIFU by editing some comments and creating an unnecessary controversy.

**tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm sorry. I won‚Äôt do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

<u/spez>: I used emacs for about 15 years before switching to 2 years ago. I still use vim. No good reason why. I love them both. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/AskReddit>: CEOs of reddit, how did you get there?

<u/spez>: I started Reddit with my college roommate of four years, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), immediately after graduation in 2005. Not having a big vision for the company, we more or less went with the flow, building whatever we felt like each day. As a result, when an opportunity to sell came along, we took it, selling to Cond√© Nast in 2006. We had little expectations for the company, so it seemed at the time like we were getting away with something.

Alexis and I stayed with Reddit, under contract with CN, through 2009. I left because I wanted to try something else. I started Hipmunk in 2010 with another buddy, Adam Goldstein. He was the CEO and I was the CTO. I worked on Hipmunk for the next five years, learning many important lessons and unlearned many bad habits I had developed at Reddit. Meanwhile, Reddit continued to grow, eventually spinning out from Conde in 2012, and raising more money towards the end of 2014.

Reddit went through some hard times (yadda yadda yadda...), and in July of 2015, I returned as CEO. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/shittychangelog>: [reddit change] /r/all algorithm changes

It was causing too much load on our database. I made a new algorithm which Trumps the previous one.

<u/KeyserSosa>: This is pretty close to our guess as to what was happening.  It wouldn't have been a stack overflow in this case, but there was an index in postgres that _turned out to be load bearing_ and without it postgres was:

1. taking an extra super long time to do something that should be simple
2. returning really weird results

That subreddit is _very_ active, and I suspect that means those rows were extra hot and see (2). 

<u/DEATH-BY-CIRCLEJERK>: Extra hot? They were sitting at the top of /r/all with a negative score lol

<u/KeyserSosa>: Poor choice of words!  Probably more like "being constantly voted on, and therefore most recently changed in postgres and the top of it's cache if it was going to return things completely unsorted."

We decided to revert before we had really figured out _what_ caused it.  I mean I guess we can flip the switch again and do a deeper dive...

<u/DEATH-BY-CIRCLEJERK>: Ah ok, that makes sense. May your next release be a successful one.

<u/rram>: This was, in fact, caused by ops.

<u/KeyserSosa>: In fairness it was also fixed by ops. 

<u/rram>: I tried pretty hard to get other teams to do the actual debugging.

<u/spez>: Ah-hem. I did most of the debugging. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Hey, it‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.

Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x‚Ä¶) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics‚Äô. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, "Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied." After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.

I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

u: I'm out for now. Will check back later. Thanks!

<u/remzem>: Have you guys done any looking into the claims of governments / political groups paying people to influence users? This seems to be something that everyone can agree on being bad, though one side would probably point to something like CTR while the other would point to something like Putin bots. Seems like a lot of the effect is likely just exaggerated and has more to do with how the upvote system can lead to the appearance of really large swings in opinion, when they are in fact not as big, if an issue is divisive. Still seems worth looking into though. Would it even be possible to tell if this sort of activity is happening? 

<u/spez>: Yes, actually. It's mostly exaggerated and largely ineffective, but people do try. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Hey, it‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.

Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x‚Ä¶) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs).

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.

We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, "Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied." After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x‚Ä¶) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs).

After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x‚Ä¶) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs).

We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, "Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied." After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

u: I'm out for now. Will check back later. Thanks!

<u/BlueMacaw>: I've entirely stopped browsing Reddit on my phone because the interface is practically unusable to me.  It may be faster now, but I no longer visit the site if my phone is the only option I have at the time.  Is there *any* way to bypass mobile view and see desktop view instead?

<u/spez>: [Yep](https://i.redd.it/a7xmc3frn52x.gif) <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Hey, it‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.

Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x‚Ä¶) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics‚Äô. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address.

<u/[deleted]>: Hey spez! Is there any additional focus being given by your poor team about the issue of catching spam? A lot of spam is reported and some of them somehow stay up, especially if they have no submission history and all their spam is exclusively comment spam.   
  


<u/spez>: Yes! Even though we've reduced spam by about 90% the last couple of quarters, it's still an ongoing battle. Please report any spam that you see.

u: I'm out for now. Will check back later. Thanks!

<u/Doctor_Dewott>: Mobile is still encountering many issues that were present since the beginning of the mobile site - such as pictures being loaded with a "play" button over them, failing the load the image and displaying "image not found" and displaying an album a few inches to the right so that it is impossible to progress through the album without going to posted link, etc.

Are these issues being worked on? Or are they back burner to larger issues?

Also, so that this comment isn't exclusively complaints, I really appreciate the faster load times and the new comment interface! It fixed many the issues I had trying to press the right button quickly. And the animation for upvoting and downvoting pretty nice!

Thanks!

Edit: a couple of typos slipped past me, whoops!

<u/spez>: Yes, those issues are being worked on. m.reddit.com was stagnant for a while while we finished up the new version, but now we're cruising again. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Hey, it‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.

We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, "Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied." After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

<u/CaptainSmashy>: How will the advertisement targeting translate to mobile applications such as BaconReader? Is it automatically integrated or possible to opt-out of for developers?

<u/spez>: We're not doing this on mobile just yet, nor are we putting ads in third party clients. If we come to that point, yes, we'll provide an opt-out anywhere this tech is used. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Hey, it‚Äôs Reddit‚Äôs totally politically neutral CEO here to provide updates and dodge questions.

Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x‚Ä¶) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers.

<u/spez>: Hillary <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/electronicmusic>: I am GRiZ, a saxophone wielding electronic funk and soul producer - I'm here to talk about music, life, and whatever else you want to talk about... AMA!

I am originally from the Metro-Detroit area but you can currently find me on tour.
We're comin' at you live today from Nashville, TN!! 

Here to discuss and celebrate the release of my new album "Good Will Prevail"
You can download it here for free: www.GoodWillPrevailAlbum.com

When I'm not performing or writing music - I enjoy cooking, yoga, skateboarding, graphic design, watching the extended works of hayao miyazak, ice cream, and a bunch of other random shit.  So go ahead and ask me anything and let's have some fun!

If you want to come party with my friends and I, get tickets to one of my upcoming shows --> www.GoodWillPrevailTour.com

<u/spez>: Yo! No question, but whenever I absolutely need to get people get up and dance, I put on GRiZ. My friends role their eyes at me by this point... but then they get up and dance. You're responsible for a lot of fun times. Thanks! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. #2 will blow your mind.

I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, we‚Äôve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we‚Äôre proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we‚Äôre testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

We‚Äôve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we‚Äôd like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We‚Äôre still in the early days, but I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, we‚Äôve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we‚Äôll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don‚Äôt want to compromise what‚Äôs brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we‚Äôre excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We‚Äôll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We‚Äôve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we‚Äôve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We‚Äôve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

<u/LogicWavelength>: hey /u/Spez!  I'm a mod for /r/Watches, and a decent chunk of our mod team uses reddit on mobile, specifically iPhones.  What is the time table for moderator tools (even just a measly remove/approve function!) coming to the mobile app?  It would be *phenomenal* to get other things, such as a separate button for mod mail, but I imagine that is not coming any time soon.

Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we‚Äôre proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we‚Äôre testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

We‚Äôve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we‚Äôd like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We‚Äôre still in the early days, but I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, we‚Äôve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we‚Äôll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don‚Äôt want to compromise what‚Äôs brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we‚Äôre excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We‚Äôll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We‚Äôve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we‚Äôve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We‚Äôve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

<u/solemn_fable>: I'm actually enjoying the official reddit app for iOS. Took a while, but it's growing on me. 

My biggest criticism: can we have an option to make the buttons on comments bigger or easier to tap?  

Usually it's simple. [Click on comment, vote buttons appear, pick my vote.]

But then there's the comments with only one or two words. Or pun threads. [Click on comment. Somehow missed and collapsed comments below it. Tap to uncollapse. Oops, tapped on commenter's username. Back out of user page. Try again til it works].

<u/silentz0r>: Apart from the front page algorithm, how about updating the really really outdated UI? Maybe even simplifying it (to make it look neater) and moving a lot of actions to a separate panel?

<u/spez>: All in due time. The majority of our traffic is mobile (and growing), and we don't have any product baggage there, so that's where our attention is. Updating desktop requires a transition plan for CSS, RES, and lots of user habits. I am chomping at the bit, though. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. #2 will blow your mind.

I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, we‚Äôve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we‚Äôre proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we‚Äôre testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

We‚Äôve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we‚Äôd like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We‚Äôre still in the early days, but I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, we‚Äôve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we‚Äôll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors.

<u/bacon_flavored>: Hi /u/spez I have a question regarding your self-serve and managed advertising platforms. Will you be expanding their capabilities in the near future (adding customizable and exportable reports for instance) or easier creative and campaign management tools?  
  
If we had the ability to fund a "bucket" that we could spend from for campaigns that would be a ton of help also when it comes to split testing things like landers and creatives without having to "lock in" a charge per-campaign.

<u/bitparity>: Purely out of curiosity, is there in any sort of works the possibility of changing the subreddit moderator system from the strict seniority that it is, to some kind of democratic form?

The most common complaint for many users and mods about Reddit is the arbitrary nature of leadership for many forums, sometimes to great detriment.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we‚Äôre excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We‚Äôll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We‚Äôve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we‚Äôve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We‚Äôve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Are you going to do anything about the  buying and selling of reddit accounts at

[Removed]


Here's what Reddit's Terms of Service says:


11 You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account.



12 You may not license, transfer, sell, or assign Your Account without our written approval.

If this is done with approval, then it just proves 100% that Reddit is controlled. 

Most likely, this isn't done with approval. How would people know that there has been a change of accounts? Why would anyone notify someone that they wish to sell their account?


Edit: First off, [gold?](https://media.giphy.com/media/1M9fmo1WAFVK0/giphy.gif)

Second, i wasnt expecting this to get as popular as it did or for /u/spez to even answer. I've Removed the site. Not giving them anymore traffic.

Also, some have been asking why this is an issue. This goes beyond CTR buying accounts and polluting /r/politics. This can jeopardize and affect the entire the site. /u/eSsEnCe_Of_EcLiPsE had a good take on it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4x35a3/click_to_hear_about_some_of_the_things_that_have/d6c3jf1):

<u/Georgy_K_Zhukov>: /u/spez,

Yesterday /r/AskHistorians was approached about being part of the A/B testing for this new 'subreddit suggestion' system you are planning for mobile and told that it "*might drive some new traffic to your subreddit*." We also were told to "*let us know if you have any questions, or see any problems*."

Well, to be frank, we *do* have questions, and we *do* see problems, but when we responded stressing /r/AskHistorians' well-known opposition to default status and asking for more information about what this new system looked like we were told, "*I'm trying to get the right answers for you, but haven't tracked anyone down yet. However, I do know that this is a topic that u/spez will be covering in his AMA in r/announcements tomorrow morning, at least in regards to the way defaults work currently and what we're looking at for the future*."

Unfortunately, this answer leaves us without any further information. So /u/spez, could you please provide us with more information about what inclusion in the A/B test entails, what the long term plan is, and whether subreddits will be able to opt out, or otherwise control how they are included.

Regards, 

Zhukov and the AH Mod Team

<u/spez>: The short-term goal is to find communities that reflect the best of Reddit and include them in some onboarding experiments we are running. We don't want to include people against their will or cause harm to communities.

<u/Porsche924>: Regarding sponsored postings. Since they won't be able to downvote off the page, it would be nice if we could see the current vote count on them anyway, when they go into negative numbers. It shows the community that while we still need to be shown ads, we don't have to like their content, it would also show products that don't fit, they don't have to keep wasting their money on advertising that the audience wouldn't embrace.

<u/spez>: I can't commit to this specifically right this moment, but in general, we want to show ads that users engage with, not ads that get crushed. It's better for everyone that way.

As it relates to monetization, we‚Äôve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we‚Äôll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don‚Äôt want to compromise what‚Äôs brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we‚Äôre excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We‚Äôll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We‚Äôve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we‚Äôve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We‚Äôve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

<u/[deleted]>: Hi spez, question about defaults.

I know I am a super evil default mod that wants my status more than anything...

But I am really happy that reddit is working on onboarding instead of the default system.

---

My question with onboarding is, do you think there will still be at least some kind of "default set"? Is it going to be more like Twitter where we HAVE to make it our own? Or do we not know yet?

Guess my question is, where do we stand when it comes to Reddit onboarding? What can we expect? Or is it too early to expect anything?

<u/spez>: A lot of this is still in the air, but the general idea is somewhere in between the current frontpage, which is set by us, and r/all, which is pretty much everything. Onboarding is a separate development effort, but will play a big role in this. We will likely have improved onboarding  before we have a new frontpage. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy. #2 will blow your mind.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

<u/KeythKatz>: I also can't remember the last time Reddit 503'ed on me. Yay!

<u/spez>: Uhhhh... great! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: New Ad Type: Promoted User Posts

**TL;DR - [here is what this ad is](https://i.redd.it/dyib2c0odmbx.png)**

Hi all,
 
We‚Äôve been working on some new ad products. When we‚Äôre thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we‚Äôre creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.
 
In conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.
 
The solution, which we‚Äôre excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we‚Äôre calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. 

How it works:

* A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content
* A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they‚Äôre interested in promoting the post
* Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post
* If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)
* The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.**

For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see [here](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png). (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)

Both of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We‚Äôll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.

While we‚Äôre launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we‚Äôll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment. Our experiment with [affiliate links](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) has ended for the time being. We‚Äôve decided that focusing our energies on advertising is more congruent with our long term strategy.

Thanks for reading, and happy redditing!

Cheers,

u/starfishjenga

**FAQ**

**Q: I don‚Äôt want my content used as an advertisement, how do I avoid this?**
No content will be turned into a promoted post without the submitter‚Äôs explicit permission. If you don‚Äôt want this to happen, either don‚Äôt answer or say no when you‚Äôre asked.

**Q: What does the promoted by link point to?**
If a brand pays to promote a post, in the bottom right corner where it says "promoted by", the advertiser will be linked so that you will know who is promoting the post. Clicking on their name will link to an advertiser-determined location. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What if my content was originally intended to point somewhere else? Do advertisers have the right to change that? Wouldn‚Äôt this change the context of the pre-existing comments?**
Your content won‚Äôt be used in this way unless you agree to let it become a promoted user post.

If you‚Äôve commented on a post that becomes a promoted user post, promoted user posts will simply create an additional link to these comments pages. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What happens to the original votes? Is this a way for companies to juice the number of upvotes to their posts?**
The vote count from the original post will be copied to the promoted post, but any upvotes applied to the promoted post will not be copied back to the original post in order to preserve the integrity of the ranking algorithm.

**Q: What happens to the original post?**
The original post still remains where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Q: What does the link in the promoted post point to?**
Promoting a post does not change the destination of the original link. If it was a self post, it goes to the self post comments page. If it was a link post, it goes to the link destination, same as before. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png)

**Q: Is there a way for us to view where our content was promoted?**
If your content is chosen for promotion and you accept, we‚Äôll give you a link to the promoted user post.

**Q: Do we get anything in return for agreeing to have our post promoted?**
This may vary across content and across time as we figure out what makes the most sense. It will generally take the form of Gold membership for some amount of time.

**Q: Won‚Äôt this encourage more users to submit content containing brands (and more fuss from /r/HailCorporate over ‚Äúshilling‚Äù)?**
We don‚Äôt believe the rewards on offer are enough to change people‚Äôs behavior in this case, but we‚Äôll keep an eye on it and deal with any problems that arise.

EDIT: have to go to a meeting but will be back at around noon PT.

EDIT 2: I'm back early because there's some confusion around what this is. Please see link at the top which I'll be updating with a more clear example.

EDIT 3: I believe some redditors may be confusing this announcement with a different one for [in-feed ad tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) which we announced prior to this.

<u/EternalNewGuy>: I know I'm a cynic, but I can't help but see this as step one towards taking promoted posts from just the top of the page and scatterering them liberally throughout the news feed.

Hopefully that won't happen, right?

<u/starfishjenga>: This is my second response to this. Please don't bury this because it's preventing people from knowing what's going to happen. I recognize this is controversial but I'm guessing you'd rather people know about it than not...

[This was announced and is currently being tested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design)

<u/[deleted]>: What happened to "It's OK to be a Redditor with a business, it's not OK for a business to have a Reddit account?"

<u/spez>: It's not practical to enforce such a rule. There are plenty of business on Reddit representing themselves legitimately, and there are plenty who masquerade as organic users. I think it's wiser to incentivize businesses to be transparent about it.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let‚Äôs all have a town hall about r/all

Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all‚Äîour specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple‚Äîas a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years‚Äîones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That‚Äôs Reddit for you. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit‚Äîlet‚Äôs remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let‚Äôs all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

u: I'm off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I'll check back in a couple hours.

<u/ThogOfWar>: Hey /u/spez, how do you feel about the new "Stickied Posts" being used only for announcement texts, disrupting services in subreddits like /r/ScenesFromAHat where they can no longer post their Scenes Of The Week properly?

I, for one, am sad :(

<u/spez>: Thanks for the feedback. We're still thinking about stickies, and will likely make more changes. In the meantime, sorry we upset your usage of it.

<u/geo1088>: So when can we expect these more changes?

The sticky changes are just bad. The new requirements are still breaking mod workflows, even though it's been said before that good mod tools should be the priority. You're just taking us backward here.

The announcement post for the new stickies seems to have the lowest upvote/downvote ration since the new search page came out, and if you [look at the "new" sort in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/?sort=new), you'll find *tons* of moderators complaining about it. The restrictions aren't changes anyone wanted, because they're limiting people's ability to moderate. Some subreddits have even had to tell users to post news as text posts, so the mods can get around these changes.

The changes made just seem so poorly thought out. I'm still not sure what you and the team were trying to accomplish by them, but I can tell you that the moderators who have to live with it are *not* happy. Something has to be changed here.

<u/spez>: Thanks for the feedback. We reverted the sticky behavior a little while ago. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let‚Äôs all have a town hall about r/all

<u/nyjets326>: Do you feel that redditors are increasingly quick to jump to conspiracy theory conclusions when any change is made? Personally I don't support the views of /r/the_donald but why not roll out this change when /r/all was dominated by Bernie Sanders related content? It seems a little opportunist and political to put forth these changes now. 

edit: I also don't support /r/SandersForPresident, I'm not sure why but the replies besides /u/spez seem to imply allegiance to one candidate or another, I just wanted to point out that reddit should look at how this type of issue affects the website throughout its history.

<u/spez>: > Do you feel that redditors are increasingly quick to jump to conspiracy theory conclusions when any change is made?

<u/MockDeath>: Having a filter for nsfw for all or a separate /r/all would be nice.

Many of us slack at work and brows reddit, at least speaking for myself it would be nice if there was less to no NSFW on a version of /r/all.

-edit- I appreciate the advice, I actually use RES everywhere but work. but I do browse reddit at lunch and breaks.. and occasionally not lunch and breaks. But if you are the frontpage of the internet, new users will not know how to filter things.

<u/ArchangelleAnnRomney>: Any news about plans to get rid of the concept of default subs?  

It seems they cause numerous problems, and you mentioned in your last announcement about /r/news that you weren't a fan of them either.

<u/spez>: No news to share, but it's very much on my mind. I'd really like communities to come and go organically. Right now, we (Reddit Inc), do the choosing, and I don't like playing kingmaker.

We have communities that come and go quickly (around major world events); rise and fall over the course of months (r/nba, r/gameofthrones); and communities that stay popular for years and years (r/iama, r/AskReddit). We'd like to be able to account for all of these situations.

<u/henx125>: Doesn't /r/all effectively do this already? Would it be too crazy to simply remove defaults and rely on /r/all being the new "default"? 

<u/spez>: Sort of, but r/all is sorted based on absolute hotness, which means a post in r/funny that has 10k upvotes and 5k downvotes will be ranked higher than a post in r/sewerhorse that has 30 upvotes and no downvotes. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let‚Äôs all have a town hall about r/all

<u/karmanaut>: Hey Spez,

I'd like to propose an *alternative* to /r/All, which would be something like /r/Outstanding.

Sorting by most upvotes is great. But what I would *really* want to see are those posts that really *exceed* the expectations of their respective subreddits. Let's say that /r/Pics regularly has posts that get to 5,000 points. Obviously those will show up in /r/All, even if they're nothing special. It's just because /r/Pics is so big, and the top post is bound to get that high.

But, at the same time, let's say that the /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds subreddit (not sure if that's a real thing) normally gets only 50 votes per post, but a post today got *100* votes. Whoa! *Double* what they regularly get. That must mean that it's a really good submission, right? That's the kind of content I want to see. 

The overall basis of it should be votes by percentage of subscribers, or something along those lines. it needs to take in the population of the subreddit into account. Obviously there would need to be some control (like if a submission in /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds was linked to in a popular /r/Askreddit post) to prevent brigading style stuff. But that can all be tweaked; just think about the concept.

--------

Pros of this system (as opposed to /r/All)

* Will allow for better subreddit discovery because small subreddits will be able to get on the list more easily.

* Takes away the advantage of massive default subreddits.

* Can't be dominated by one subreddit regularly, unless it continually exceeds its previous records (which would be really difficult). 

* Would really highlight the very best of Reddit or the most important news. 

<u/spez>: So, that's approximately how the current front page works. We normalize the scores and sort by the most outstanding. It's limited to defaults / subscriptions, though.

You basically describe the new frontpage algorithm I've been fantasizing about. We started work on this, in fact, but we re-allocated that brainpower (u/KeyserSosa) to focus on anti-evil for a while. We have since hired more brainpower and have less evil, so I'm hopeful we can get back to it soon.

<u/reboticon>: Can you expand on what you mean by 'having less evil?'

I like this /r/all change and I like that you made an announcement about it.

<u/spez>: > Can you expand on what you mean by 'having less evil?'

We've made a lot of progress fighting spam, Account Take Overs (ATOs), and reported abuse over the past few months. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let‚Äôs all have a town hall about r/all

u: I'm off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I'll check back in a couple hours.

<u/raven12456>: How will this affect when an event occurs and a subreddit has a lot of activity? (Ex- /r/Sports or sport specific subs during playoffs/finals, /r/news when something happens before it gets rolled into a megathread, /r/DOTA 2 during The Internationals, etc) Will we be seeing less of those on r/all when that happens? 

<u/spez>: You'll see fewer powers from the same community. This is one of those cases where we might be throwing out some of the good with the bad. We'll keep a watch during major events and see how it feels. I don't believe r/all or our current front page is the best solution for Reddit, but it's the best we have right now. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let‚Äôs all have a town hall about r/all

<u/karmanaut>: Hey Spez,

I'd like to propose an *alternative* to /r/All, which would be something like /r/Outstanding.

Sorting by most upvotes is great. But what I would *really* want to see are those posts that really *exceed* the expectations of their respective subreddits. Let's say that /r/Pics regularly has posts that get to 5,000 points. Obviously those will show up in /r/All, even if they're nothing special. It's just because /r/Pics is so big, and the top post is bound to get that high.

But, at the same time, let's say that the /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds subreddit (not sure if that's a real thing) normally gets only 50 votes per post, but a post today got *100* votes. Whoa! *Double* what they regularly get. That must mean that it's a really good submission, right? That's the kind of content I want to see. 

The overall basis of it should be votes by percentage of subscribers, or something along those lines. it needs to take in the population of the subreddit into account. Obviously there would need to be some control (like if a submission in /r/PicsOfUnusualBirds was linked to in a popular /r/Askreddit post) to prevent brigading style stuff. But that can all be tweaked; just think about the concept.

--------

Pros of this system (as opposed to /r/All)

* Will allow for better subreddit discovery because small subreddits will be able to get on the list more easily.

* Takes away the advantage of massive default subreddits.

* Can't be dominated by one subreddit regularly, unless it continually exceeds its previous records (which would be really difficult). 

* Would really highlight the very best of Reddit or the most important news. 

<u/spez>: So, that's approximately how the current front page works. We normalize the scores and sort by the most outstanding. It's limited to defaults / subscriptions, though.

You basically describe the new frontpage algorithm I've been fantasizing about. We started work on this, in fact, but we re-allocated that brainpower (u/KeyserSosa) to focus on anti-evil for a while. We have since hired more brainpower and have less evil, so I'm hopeful we can get back to it soon. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let‚Äôs all have a town hall about r/all

Will this have an effect on the hotness over the period of a day or over a longer period? Because this would not only prevent the_D, but also subs like r/funny, r/gaming and r/adviceanimals from dominating r/all.

<u/spez>: It's just for the specific rendering of the r/all listing. So, it'll affect all communities with r/all itself, but not on the listings for the actual communities.

It seems they cause numerous problems, and you mentioned in your last announcement about /r/news that you weren't a fan of them either.

<u/spez>: No news to share, but it's very much on my mind. I'd really like communities to come and go organically. Right now, we (Reddit Inc), do the choosing, and I don't like playing kingmaker.

We have communities that come and go quickly (around major world events); rise and fall over the course of months (r/nba, r/gameofthrones); and communities that stay popular for years and years (r/iama, r/AskReddit).

<u/Squeagley>: You dropped these -> _ _

<u/spez>: Found them. Thank you. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk about Orlando

Hi All,

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let‚Äôs remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news‚Äô policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

We are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We‚ÄìReddit Inc, moderators, and users‚Äìall have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:

* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
* [We‚Äôre introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They‚Äôll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.

Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We‚Äôve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. 

<u/thebaron2>: > A few posts were removed incorrectly

Isn't this the understatement of the century? The amount of DELETED comments in those threads was *insane* and it turned out many of them didn't come *close* to violating any policy. Identifying where to go to donate blood?

>We have investigated

Will this be a transparent investigation or is this all you guys have to say on the matter?

>it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators

While I agree with the sentiment, it's really bad form, IMO, to include this here, in this post. Part of the disdain for how this was handled included the /r/news mods blaming the users for *their* behavior.

>This is a responsibility we take seriously.

This is hard to take seriously if theres a) no accountability, b) no transparency, and c) no acknowledgement of how HORRIBLY this whole incident was handled. This post effectively comes down to "One mod crossed the line. And by the way, don't harass mods ever."

>We‚ÄìReddit Inc, moderators, and users‚Äìall have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

What happens when you - Reddit Inc and moderators (I'd argue that regular users do not have a duty to provide access to info) - fail in this duty? If it's a serious responsibility, as you claim, are there repercussions or is there any accountability, at all, when the system fails?

*edit: their/there correction

<u/spez>: Honestly, I'm quite upset myself. As a user, I was disappointed that when I wanted to learn what happened in Orlando, and I found a lot of infighting bullshit. We're still getting to the bottom of it all. Fortunately, the [AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4nqnrm/breaking_news_orlando_nightclub_massshooting/) was quite good.

All of us at Reddit are committed to making sure this doesn't happen again, and we're working with the mods to do so. We have historically stayed hands off and let these situations develop, but in this case we should have stepped in. Next time we will get involved sooner to make sure things don't go off the rails.


 <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/changelog>: Renaming "sticky posts" to "announcements"

Now that some time has been passed since [we opened up sticky posts to more types of content](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3d7i0q/moderators_you_can_now_have_two_stickies_in_your/), we've noticed that for the most part stickies are used for community-centric announcements and event-specific mega-threads.  As such, we've decided to refine the feature and explicitly start referring to them as "announcements."  

The mechanics around announcements will be quite similar to stickies with the constraint that the sticky post must be either:

 * a text post
 * a link to live threads
 * a link to wiki pages

~~Additionally, the author of the post must be a moderator at the time of the announcement.~~  [Redacted.  See Edit 2!]

Then changes can be found [here](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/ba9dc13eb579c3e8f90b41cecd460961cebeb91b).

<u/-run>: This thread will go well.

<u/spez>: I'd say it's going exactly as expected. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk about Orlando

Hi All,

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let‚Äôs remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news‚Äô policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

<u/[deleted]>: Remove r/news from default subs

<u/spez>: I'm not a fan of defaults in general. They made sense at the time, but we've outgrown them. They create a few problems, the most important of which is that new communities can't grow into popularity. They also assume a one-size-fits all editorial approach, and we can do better now. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/changelog>: Renaming "sticky posts" to "announcements"

Now that some time has been passed since [we opened up sticky posts to more types of content](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/3d7i0q/moderators_you_can_now_have_two_stickies_in_your/), we've noticed that for the most part stickies are used for community-centric announcements and event-specific mega-threads.  As such, we've decided to refine the feature and explicitly start referring to them as "announcements."  

The mechanics around announcements will be quite similar to stickies with the constraint that the sticky post must be either:

<u/Umdlye>: Surely I can't be the only person who frequently stickied relevant important posts by non-moderators? First thing that comes to mind is developer Q&A's in gaming subreddits. Link submission stickies were really useful too.

I've been out of the loop for the last week or so because of holidays, so I'm not sure what led up to this change but it's really inconvenient. What if stickied posts just didn't show up in /r/all?

<u/CaptainDogeSparrow>: What do you have to say about one of /r/mods telling a user to "Kill yourself"?

<u/spez>: It's totally inappropriate and that person is no longer a mod.

<u/Buelldozer>: C'mon, none of us here are stupid. That mod account was 4 months old, it was clearly someone's sock puppet and it's highly likely that person is another mod on the team. No account goes from new to moderator of a default sub (with almost no history) in 4 months.

This kind of crud threatens your business, the business of Reddit Inc, and you'd better start taking it more seriously.

<u/spez>: My understanding is it was a new account from an old mod. His original account is also gone. He stepped down about a year ago when he got a new job, and returned a few months ago. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/changelog>: Renaming "sticky posts" to "announcements"

---

So what happens to regular sticky posts. A few of my subreddits use sticky posts as a gathering of information. Can only mods make sticky aka announcement posts? What if a news info like E3 for the gaming subs, a user makes a post first, and we want to honor that by making a collective discussion thread? Are we not able to do that and we as mods would have to create our own announcement post just to sticky it?

Examples when we would sticky a users post:

1. They create a really detailed helpful post with information, and we want to direct users to it
2. Mods are asleep and a user gets the drop on a game update, or E3 coverage, or some other bit of information. We like to reduce redundant threads, so direct discussion to a single thread and make this a stickied megathread.
3. An important new story breaks out (current event) and the mods want to sticky that for visibility. 

Users kinda get angry if mods remove threads to make their own, especially when users get a big drop on the mods in terms of time. Not exactly the best PR for us to remove a post and make our own just so we can sticky it to get users attention.

So what are we supposed to do? Make a announcement thread with a link to the users thread and lock our thread just as a redirect?

<u/spez>: These are good points. We're hearing the feedback and will discuss.

<u/a_calder>: /u/spez, why has Reddit not put more effort into promoting /r/live posts?  I find them much more useful than some mega-thread that is difficult to keep track of.

* Can you make it easier for mods to link to /r/live threads?  
* Could you create a method for merging two live threads if they are the same subject (and the creators want to merge them)?


<u/spez>: Agreed. We haven't invested in the technology in a while, but even in its current state, they're very useful for these big events, and I regret not promoting one in this case. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk about Orlando

Hi everyone,

Today we‚Äôre launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon won‚Äôt be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled ‚Äúreplace all affiliate links‚Äù.

The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link. The link displayed on hover will match the original link. Clicking will forward users through a third-party service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination. We‚Äôve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they won't store user data or cookies during this process.

We‚Äôre structuring this as a test so we can better evaluate the opportunity. There are a variety of ways we can improve this feature, but we want to learn if it‚Äôs worth our time. It‚Äôs important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist. To that end, we will explore a variety of monetization opportunities. Not everything will work, and we appreciate your understanding while we experiment.

Thanks for your support.

Cheers,

Some FAQs:

**Will this work with my adblocker?**
Yes, we specifically tested for this case and it should work fine.

**Are the outgoing links HTTPS?**
Yes.

**Why are you using a third party instead of just implementing it yourselves?**
Integrating five thousand merchants across multiple countries is non-trivial. Using Viglink allowed us to integrate a much larger number of merchants than we would have been able to do ourselves.

**Can I switch this off for my subreddit?**
Not right now, but we will be discussing this with subreddit mods who are significantly affected before a wider rollout.

**Will this change be reflected in the site FAQ?**
~~Yes, this will be completed shortly.~~ This is available [here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT (additional FAQ): Will the opt out be for links I post, or links I view?** When you opt out, neither content you post nor content you view will be affiliatized.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 2): What will this look like in practice?** If I post a link to [a storm trooper necklace](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Wars-Storm-Trooper-3D-Necklace/111817866493?_trksid=p2047675.c100009.m1982&_trkparms=aid%3D777000%26algo%3DABA.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131227121020%26meid%3Daa3df26a727e4999b28c34077939ff19%26pid%3D100009%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D112015566756) and don't opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link, it will be rewritten so that you're redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made.

**EDIT 3** We've added some questions about this feature to the [FAQ](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT 4** For those asking about the ability to opt out - based on your feedback we'll make the opt out available to everyone (not just those in the test group), so that if the feature rolls out more widely then you'll already be opted out *provided you have changed the user setting*. This will go live later today.

**EDIT 5** The user preference has been added for *all* users. If you do not want to participate, go ahead and uncheck the box in your user preferences labeled "replace affiliate links" and content you create or view will not have affiliate links added.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 3): Can I get an ELI5?** When you click on a link to some (~5k) online stores, Reddit will get a percentage of the revenue of any purchase. If you don't like this, you can opt out via the user preference labeled "replace affiliate links".

**EDIT (additional FAQ 4): The name of the user preference is confusing, can you change it?** Feedback taken, thanks. The preference will be changed to "change links into Reddit affiliate links". I'll update the text above when the change rolls out. Thanks!

**EDIT (additional FAQ 5): What will happen to existing affiliate links?** This won't interfere with existing affiliate links.

<u/ProfoundlyProfound>: Why are power mods still allowed, you know the ones, they lord over 100-300 subs squatting and waiting for them to become relevant...and then they promptly treat redditors like garbage?

Visit /r/MakingAMurderer sometime, one just absolutely destroyed it.  They all had to flee to another sub /r/TickTockManitowoc. (Another example reached the [front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/4m8kii/the_inmates_are_truly_running_the_asylum/) yesterday.)

This is an all too common practice and I don't understand why this type of behavior is allowed? Why are we allowing power mods to exist? 

Edit: Hey Spez, [look](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4megfw/ama_about_my_darkest_secrets/d3uw68h), one of the very I guys I was talking about turned up. Here's your chance to see for yourself and give us some sort of answer on the issue.

<u/spez>: This is a tricky one. The problems we see are a result of a couple of decisions we made a long time ago, not understanding their longterm consequences: simplistic moderator hierarchy and valuable real-estate in r/ urls. Unwinding these decisions requires a lot of thought and finesse. Reddit wouldn't exist as it does today without the good moderators, and we need to be very careful to continue to empower them while filtering out the bad actors.

<u/K_Lobstah>: Hi Steve,  
  
I think the last one of these I inquired about the on-boarding process for new user accounts. Has that made its way into the timetable yet?  
  
I'd like to once again emphasize my belief that a thorough introduction to the site, its philosophies, how it works, and the actual nature of subreddits as independent communities will cut out SO many issues faced by both users and moderators.  
  
An effective presentation to first-time users could really solve a lot of little issues that we frequently see compound into larger ones.  
  
Regardless of the answer, thanks for taking time to do another of these. They're always interesting and informative.

<u/spez>: Yes, but we throw away IPs after 100 days.

> Can you see the main account of a throwaway?

Sort of. No one's looking. If they happen to share an IP, it's possible, but many IPs, for example at a college, have many hundreds of accounts on them.

edit: I should clarify. There is no such thing as a "super mod," and only select Reddit employees have access to IPs.

Does this herald the implementation of highly targeted advertising based on subreddit preferences, or  perhaps something much more sinister, like mass data collection which could then be sold on? I think if you could clarify these comments it might put people slightly more at ease.

<u/spez>: We would like to make better use of all the data we have. The front page could be a lot more relevant; we can make better content suggestions; and yes, ads can be better targeted. There are many opportunities to make Reddit better and more relevant.

We're not actually doing it now. I've mentioned this sort of thing before. When do, we'll always provide an opt-out or way of resetting things.

No, we'll don't ever share this sort of information directly with advertisers. We sometimes have to jump through a lot of hoops to accomplish this, but we don't mind at all. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: AMA about my darkest secrets

Hi All,

We haven‚Äôt done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

We‚Äôve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and we‚Äôre hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, and‚Äìof course‚Äìhiring.

<u/ConfusedHerring>: What's the best and worst thing about running Reddit?

<u/spez>: The best part is being a part of something so important to so many people. It's a lot of fun most of the time, and even when it's not fun, it's very exciting and challenging. It's not always easy to find that in a job, and I'm really fortunate to have it in mine.

Today we are excited to announce that [Philippe Beaudette](https://www.reddit.com/u/AchievementUnlockd) has joined us to lead our Community team. He comes from Wikipedia by way of Wikia. At the Wikimedia Foundation (which hosts and supports Wikipedia, among other sites) he was responsible for the team that did community management, user trust and safety, and strategic change management, guiding the community through a time of immense growth and maturation. He spent almost 7 years there, as one of their first community hires, and managed to have his fingers on a huge number of projects, from fundraising (raising money from nearly every country in the world and accepting Wikipedia‚Äôs first donation from Antarctica) to community governance and their international elections processes‚Äìwhile dealing with communities working in almost 200 different languages.  He‚Äôs particularly proud to have led their community interactions around a worldwide [24 hour site shut-down](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/wikipedia-blackout_n_1212096.html?slideshow=true) to drive awareness of the SOPA bill two years ago, an effort that Reddit also joined.

After leaving Wikipedia, Philippe joined Wikia and ran the Community Support and Engagement team there, supporting Wikia‚Äôs 350,000 fan-created communities. We are honored to have him on our team. Please welcome Philippe!

In addition to Philippe, we have brought on an additional five members to the Community and Trust and Safety teams this week. See if you can collect them all!

<u/pomosexuality>: Welcome!

Spez, are the new hires going to be heavy on user interaction? I'd love to see a brief introduction to the additional folks who we'll also be speaking with very often, if it isn't a bother. Looking forward to having all of you around :)

<u/spez>: Some will, yes, and we'll introduce them in time as they ramp up. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: A few updates on what has been keeping us busy

Hi All,

I want to give you all an update with the things that are keeping us busy, and hopefully as a result, making you less busy:

* **Spam**: Last quarter we saw a huge increase in spam, including a handful of heavy attacks. We diverted resources to combat this, and we have made quite a bit of progress, lowering user reported spam by over 60% from its high point last quarter. We still have plenty of work to do, but we are making steady progress. Removing as spam or reporting as such are still the most effective ways to help.

* **Account Take-Overs** (ATOs): In response to our improved spam-fighting measures, the bad-guys have been targeting existing accounts, compromising them for the purpose of spamming and vote cheating. We are fighting ATOs on the engineering side, but ATOs also create a burden on our community team to notify affected users, send password reset emails, etc. We are working on automating the notification and recovery processes to free up our community managers. The root cause of the issue is poor passwords. Please use strong and unique passwords.

* **Support Backlog**: Because of the aforementioned issues, our community team is swamped with support tickets. We are doing a good job keeping up with the incoming flow, but we do have a backlog that is taking time to work through. We are sorry for any delays. The good news is we have a number of new people joining the team over the next few weeks that will help.

* **Modmail**: I am happy to report that we finally have a team dedicated to working on a new system for moderator mail. To this point, we have tried a number of approaches and have had a handful of false starts, but we have not made the sort of progress we would like. The current system is a series of hacks built on an old code base, and because of this, we have decided to build modmail as a new, separate system. This will allow us to develop it without disrupting your current workflows. We know this is where you spend a lot of your time, and we are working hard to make it more effective.

We appreciate all you do for Reddit as moderators, and we appreciate seeing the questions you ask in this community. We are particularly thankful for those of you who jump in and help the other moderators here and elsewhere.

Yes, we will add that in time, but it doesn't solve the acute problem. Many of the compromised accounts are old / inactive / owned by users who have shitty passwords. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: A few updates on what has been keeping us busy

AMA!

### Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm Alex‚ÄìI joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I‚Äôm excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I‚Äôve been a Redditor for eight years and it‚Äôs a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What‚Äôs New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans‚Äîthere are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We‚Äôve made progress on many fronts since I‚Äôve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we‚Äôve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We‚Äôve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We‚Äôre proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

So here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we‚Äôve built for you.

### What‚Äôs Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we‚Äôll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we‚Äôll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We‚Äôd love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I‚Äôll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

Thanks!  
Alex

**Noon PT Edit:** Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team ‚Äì we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.

**11PM PT Edit:** Ok I've been answering on and off all day. I will keep reading top comments but will be replying less now. 

<u/316nuts>: why should i use your android app instead of something like reddit is fun, baconreader, reddit news, reddit sync, etc

what do you bring to the table that they don't?

you're going to have to do some pretty fancy tricks to get me to move away from paid RIF. 

edit:  no mod functions?  i'm out. let me know when it gets updated. 

UI is pretty.  

i already turned disabled the big image previews because it takes up too much room. compact has thumbnails.

not sure why you have the upvotes displayed on the right even though it's on the left for 99% of reddit's pages.

i like how it shows the users here and subscribers at the top of a subreddit

when i click on a user name it takes me to *either* posts or comments, why can't i get an overview?

the user page only shows one type of karma? weird.

do you have the ability to change image settings based on whether or not you're on wifi? that would be nice. 

the image submission feature is nice - especially how it shows "recent communities" that i've posted to, but i want to be able to navigate in my own library, click on the share icon, and be able to choose your app instead of having to do it all through your app. dunno if that's a big deal, or just habit for me. 

my image submission is uploading slowly/poorly.  is there a file size limit? it's been submitting for awhile now. 

alright, i tried to upload an image through your app and it took forever, so i cancelled.  Sometimes imgur hates when i upload super-big images and i'm usually too lazy to make them smaller.  I cropped and make it a smaller file just for the hell of it, which 99.9999% of the time makes imgur happy.  aaaaaaaaand i'm still waiting for it to submit. dunno what to say about that, i'll just let it sit here and try to submit for awhile i guess?

not sure how i feel about the various fonts mixing it up in my account history section. also personally not a huge fan of it being auto-abbreviated?  I get it.. but it's just a bit weird for me.  it'll be a BIG deal to a lot of people that they can't see their vote counts here. 

i kinda like when i'm browsing my front page and i click on an external link that it takes me to the reddit comment section with a preview of the content above.  .... or maybe i want to complain about being required to make an extra click to see the full content? hmmmmm.  I will say that it doesn't ALWAYS give an image preview, so there are instances where you're kinda forcing me to click on the content twice to see it. 

i like the comment reply dialog where it shows the original comment at the top and i have a lot of white space at the bottom to work with. Oh.. but when i do that, i can't select the above text to copy/paste? I also don't have the option to quote the text above.  I guess i could pre-copy the text before i reply, then click reply, then paste it..

two serious nickpicky things with my inbox.  first, it's "messages" and not actually my "default inbox"  that's going to be kinda confusing to a lot of people?  I moderate places and /messages/ threads all of that stuff in a very weird fashion in there. I get direct messages, modmail, etc all bundled together in a not-fun way. I want to see my direct messages. 

modmail is REALLY weird. nevermind it's lack of functionality, i can't really see what's even going on? It doesn't open the full modmail or even the full message.  When a user is banned, i can't even see who the message is going to.  I know your goal isn't to babysit the moderators around here, but it seems to lack basic functionality of being able to read messages at all. 

[okay sorry, i think i'm done for awhile. didn't mean to edit it 927 times but i did anyway.](http://i.imgur.com/N7FGiSB.jpg).  There's a lot of stuff I like about it and look forward to its evolution. 



<u/ggAlex>: >why should i use your android app instead of something like reddit is fun, baconreader, reddit news, reddit sync, etc
>what do you bring to the table that they don't?

  
Our 3rd party apps are great ‚Äì they've filled the void during the time when we didn't have apps. If you enjoy those other clients, please keep using them. We're going to focus on making our apps the best they can be for as many Redditors as we can. That might involve some compromises that don't work for all of our users and we're ok with that. That's why we care about staying committed to our free API.
  

>you're going to have to do some pretty fancy tricks to get me to move away from paid RIF.

[like this?](https://d26oc3sg82pgk3.cloudfront.net/files/media/filer_public/2015/07/30/07_summer.gif)

>edit: no mod functions? i'm out. let me know when it gets updated.

I'll PM you when they're available.

>UI is pretty.

Thank you! 

>i already turned disabled image previews because it taks up too much room.

Customizability is important to Redditors. It is known.

>not sure why you have the upvotes displayed on the right even though it's on the left for 99% of reddit's pages.

You've pointed out a clear example of our bias against r/southpaws. We will be supporting gesture actions for voting soon.

>i like how it shows the users here and subscribers at the top of a subreddit

Me too!

>when i click on a user name it takes me to either posts or comments, why can't i get an overview?

Noted. 

>the user page only shows one type of karma? weird.

We got this into the iOS build at the last minute and didn't quite make it into Android. Different platforms different challenges. We're working hard to get to full feature parity and it will be an ongoing effort.

>do you have the ability to change image settings based on whether or not you're on wifi? that would be nice.

That's a great idea that we didn't think of. I've noted it.

>the image submission feature is nice - especially how it shows "recent communities" that i've posted to, but i want to be able to navigate in my own library, click on the share icon, and be able to choose your app instead of having to do it all through your app. dunno if that's a big deal, or just habit for me.

This is coming.

>my image submission is uploading slowly/poorly. is there a file size limit? it's been submitting for awhile now.
>alright, i tried to upload an image through your app and it took forever, so i cancelled. Sometimes imgur hates when i upload super-big images and i'm usually too lazy to make them smaller. I cropped and make it a smaller file just for the hell of it, which 99.9999% of the time makes imgur happy. aaaaaaaaand i'm still waiting for it to submit. dunno what to say about that, i'll just let it sit here and try to submit for awhile i guess?

There is a size limit. We'll be improving image uploading as we learn more about how people are using it.

>not sure how i feel about the various fonts mixing it up in my account history section. also personally not a huge fan of it being auto-abbreviated? I get it.. but it's just a bit weird for me. it'll be a BIG deal to a lot of people that they can't see their vote counts here.

We will fix that page. In our last submission that page had a bit of a regression. We're moving fast and breaking things. It'll get better.

>i kinda like when i'm browsing my front page and i click on an external link that it takes me to the reddit comment section with a preview of the content above. .... or maybe i want to complain about being required to make an extra click to see the full content? hmmmmm. I will say that it doesn't ALWAYS give an image preview, so there are instances where you're kinda forcing me to click on the content twice to see it.

Make up your mind! We'll try to make up ours :)

>i like the comment reply dialog where it shows the original comment at the top and i have a lot of white space at the bottom to work with. Oh.. but when i do that, i can't select the above text to copy/paste? I also don't have the option to quote the text above. I guess i could pre-copy the text before i reply, then click reply, then paste it..

Good point! We've noted this.

>two serious nickpicky things with my inbox. first, it's "messages" and not actually my "default inbox" that's going to be kinda confusing to a lot of people? I moderate places and /messages/ threads all of that stuff in a very weird fashion in there. I get direct messages, modmail, etc all bundled together in a not-fun way. I want to see my direct messages.

This is noted. Might not get to it right away though.

>modmail is REALLY weird. nevermind it's lack of functionality, i can't really see what's even going on? It doesn't open the full modmail or even the full message. When a user is banned, i can't even see who the message is going to. I know your goal isn't to babysit the moderators around here, but it seems to lack basic functionality of being able to read messages at all.

To be frank, it wasn't the highest priority item to make the mod workflow great on the app. I commit to making it better as we go forward.  On a broader note we want to save you from having to do so much dirty work.


<u/PreludesAndNocturnes>: Made the jump from Alien Blue. 

- Please bring back the gesture shortcuts like swiping left on a comment to collapse the whole thread, or two-finger-tap to upvote!

- Switching to Compact view appears to work for individual subreddits, but my front page is still in Card view?

- I miss being able to press + hold on video/gif thumbnails in comments to preview them without leaving the comments

Everything else seems like a good start for now. Keep up the good work, I'm sure you guys have more awesome stuff coming

<u/spez>: > Please bring back the gesture shortcuts like swiping left on a comment to collapse the whole thread, or two-finger-tap to upvote!

Instead of swipe to collapse, there is a little button in the lower right to skip to the next thread. You can move it around with press-and-hold. Swipe to collapse was my favorite feature ever, and I think this button is a nice improvement.

> Switching to Compact view appears to work for individual subreddits, but my front page is still in Card view?

There is a global preference for compact view as well.


<u/enriqueDFTL>: I would prefer the button to skip to next thread to be at the top right. The bottom right corner is the toughest to reach. :(

<u/spez>: You can tap and hold and move it around. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit Mobile Apps

**tl;dr**: I‚Äôm new, we‚Äôre launching two apps today in the US, UK, Canada and Australia: [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), send us your feedback, we‚Äôll keep making them better for you. AMA!

### Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm Alex‚ÄìI joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I‚Äôm excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I‚Äôve been a Redditor for eight years and it‚Äôs a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What‚Äôs New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans‚Äîthere are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We‚Äôve made progress on many fronts since I‚Äôve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we‚Äôve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We‚Äôve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We‚Äôre proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

So here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we‚Äôve built for you.

### What‚Äôs Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we‚Äôll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we‚Äôll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We‚Äôd love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I‚Äôll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

Thanks!  
Alex

**Noon PT Edit:** Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team ‚Äì we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.

**11PM PT Edit:** Ok I've been answering on and off all day. I will keep reading top comments but will be replying less now. 

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: Every app is featureless compared to AlienBlue. Seriously, I learned about new hidden features just this morning.

This is just version 1! More to come.

<u/Zaydene>: >Every app is featureless compared to AlienBlue

Said it yourself, why start from scratch when there has been a flawless Alien Blue for YEARS. Even when reddit bought Jase out, Alien Blue just got even better. You can't even view NSFW content on this new crap. How out of touch are the guys working there?

<u/spez>: That was our first approach, in fact, but we found we could set ourselves up to move faster down the road with a new codebase.

You can enable NSFW in the preferences. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit Mobile Apps

<u/316nuts>: why should i use your android app instead of something like reddit is fun, baconreader, reddit news, reddit sync, etc

what do you bring to the table that they don't?

you're going to have to do some pretty fancy tricks to get me to move away from paid RIF. 

edit:  no mod functions?  i'm out. let me know when it gets updated. 

UI is pretty.  

i already turned disabled the big image previews because it takes up too much room. compact has thumbnails.

not sure why you have the upvotes displayed on the right even though it's on the left for 99% of reddit's pages.

i like how it shows the users here and subscribers at the top of a subreddit

when i click on a user name it takes me to *either* posts or comments, why can't i get an overview?

the user page only shows one type of karma? weird.

do you have the ability to change image settings based on whether or not you're on wifi? that would be nice. 

the image submission feature is nice - especially how it shows "recent communities" that i've posted to, but i want to be able to navigate in my own library, click on the share icon, and be able to choose your app instead of having to do it all through your app. dunno if that's a big deal, or just habit for me.

<u/ggAlex>: >why should i use your android app instead of something like reddit is fun, baconreader, reddit news, reddit sync, etc

Our 3rd party apps are great ‚Äì they've filled the void during the time when we didn't have apps. If you enjoy those other clients, please keep using them. We're going to focus on making our apps the best they can be for as many Redditors as we can. That might involve some compromises that don't work for all of our users and we're ok with that. That's why we care about staying committed to our free API.

### Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm Alex‚ÄìI joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I‚Äôm excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I‚Äôve been a Redditor for eight years and it‚Äôs a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What‚Äôs New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans‚Äîthere are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We‚Äôve made progress on many fronts since I‚Äôve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we‚Äôve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We‚Äôve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We‚Äôre proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we‚Äôve built for you.

### What‚Äôs Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we‚Äôll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we‚Äôll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We‚Äôd love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I‚Äôll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

<u/spez>: Every app is featureless compared to AlienBlue. Seriously, I learned about new hidden features just this morning.

This is just version 1! More to come. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report

In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we‚Äôve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn‚Äôt easy as a small company as we don‚Äôt always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

<u/chengiz>: > **India** We received 11 requests from cyber crime investigation authorities in India requesting the removal of content, which was allegedly ‚Äúdisturbing public order‚Äù. None were complied with, with a majority of the content not being hosted by Reddit. 

However the table just above this says 8 posts and 1 user account were affected. What does that mean? In what ways can posts/users be affected if requests arent complied with?

<u/spez>: In India, you're right our phrasing could be better, and we'll take into account for our next report.  The "What was affected" means that the 11 requests related to 8 posts and 1 user account (there were 3 requests related to that 1 user account).  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report

In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we‚Äôve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn‚Äôt easy as a small company as we don‚Äôt always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

In 2016, we‚Äôve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users.

 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/01356)

<u/spez>: My understanding is we can delete whatever we want, unless we receive a "preservation request."

We keep the deleted comments in an attempt to preserve the continuity of conversation. It's purely a product decision.

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: The behavior is different when someone explicitly deletes a comment (we don't show it) versus deleting their account (we don't show the account name on the comment).

update to answer some questions:

When a user deletes a comment, we keep the body of the comment, but we don't display it anywhere. The reason was it simplified the implementation at the time. That's not a sacred horse, and it's something we can reconsider. In the context of this conversation, I don't believe we've ever turned over deleted comments (I don't think anyone has asked, either).

If you modify a comment, we don't keep previous versions.

<u/adeadhead>: In 2014, reddit didnt give out any information when requested by non US government bodies. In 2015, it did, despite still being a US company. Were those disclosures legal obligations or reddit simply willingly disclosing information? (Also, what is an 'emergency request'?)




Edit: as is mentioned in a lower comment, the gag canary is no longer present in this years report. Thats not the sort of thing that would have been accidently been omitted.  

<u/spez>: ~~We didn't receive any in 2014, I believe.~~ We received 5 in 2014, but didn't disclose any information. In 2015, we complied with one non-emergency foreign request from Canada because we ended up receiving a subpoena from the US Department of Homeland Security as well. The other foreign requests were emergency requests.

An emergency request is something like a suicide or bomb threat.

update: clarified the foreign requests.

<u/[deleted]>: > In 2015, it did, despite still being a US company. Were those disclosures legal obligations or reddit simply willingly disclosing information? 

You skirted right over this. Whats the answer?

<u/spez>: We never willingly hand over information. I don't know this specific case off the top of my head, but I will ask.

<u/slyf>: Interesting to note that the national security Canary in the 2014 transparency report is no longer present in the 2015 transparency report.

<u/spez>: Even with the canaries, we're treading a fine line. The whole thing is icky, which is why we [joined Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf) in pushing back.

<u/CarrollQuigley>: It sounds like reddit has received a National Security Letter since January 29, 2015.

<u/sageDieu>: That's the entire point of the canary, he isn't allowed to say anything about it, the fact it was removed means that a gag order has been issued. 100% final, no discussion.

<u/lazyfrag>: Or that Reddit decided to remove it voluntarily, for some reason. I don't think that that's likely; I just think it's a bit much to say with 100% certainty that a letter was received. It's a problem inherent to canaries.

Edit: /u/spez says below that he's been advised not to say, so it could go either way, though it's still more likely they received a request.

<u/TelicAstraeus>: if that were true, there would be no reason for /u/spez not to say so.

edit: time to subscribe to /r/privacy. edit2: also https://www.privacytools.io/

<u/MrLegilimens>: >
In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, 

I'm curious what kind of requests were made in which you did provide records? I'm just confused why / what would it take to make both a government say "We want to know about /u/MrLegilimens" but also what would make you say Yes (or no).

<u/spez>: Our [law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines) document how we can be legally compelled to share information.

Our general strategy is to store as little as possible to minimize our surface area. I also encourage users to share as little as possible for the same reason. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report

In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we‚Äôve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn‚Äôt easy as a small company as we don‚Äôt always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

<u/adeadhead>: In 2014, reddit didnt give out any information when requested by non US government bodies. In 2015, it did, despite still being a US company. Were those disclosures legal obligations or reddit simply willingly disclosing information? (Also, what is an 'emergency request'?)




Edit: as is mentioned in a lower comment, the gag canary is no longer present in this years report. Thats not the sort of thing that would have been accidently been omitted.  

<u/spez>: ~~We didn't receive any in 2014, I believe.~~ We received 5 in 2014, but didn't disclose any information. In 2015, we complied with one non-emergency foreign request from Canada because we ended up receiving a subpoena from the US Department of Homeland Security as well. The other foreign requests were emergency requests.

An emergency request is something like a suicide or bomb threat.

update: clarified the foreign requests. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: For your reading pleasure, our 2015 Transparency Report

<u/shiverstar>: I can see right through your report.

<u/spez>: Fastest pun in the West. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: 1+ Month with no admin response on ban evaders

I mod a few trading subs and we have significant issues with ban evaders and malicious impersonators. Initially the admins were very responsive. I provide a list of known ban evaders and impersonators and I usually got feedback within 24 hours or a couple of days at the most. It began to taper off a couple of months ago with response times getting slower and slower until finally nothing. I've bumped the last reply I got from them with new information and requests to reply but have gotten nothing for over a month. 

I'd like to know if they're not responding to ban evasion anymore or if there's some sort of policy change that they just haven't disclosed. A month with no response though is frustrating and I'd like to know what's going on. 

<u/spez>: PM me the info, and I'll take a look.

edit: looks like we got to it a couple of days ago before I saw this.

<u/soundeziner>: Any comments on what appears to be a reduced admin presence and/or interaction with mods?

<u/[deleted]>: I believe it. There's a person in /r/cocaine who has been stalking one of the mods literally for years. He creates a new account, replies to something the mod posts with doxxing info and ad hominem attacks, and gets banned. I report him to the admins time and time again and all I hear are empty promises that he's been dealt with. Yet, every few weeks like clockwork I have to deal with this guy and report him again to the admins. And also, don't even bother reporting someone on the weekends. No one is working at reddit apparently because for the last few months, the only way I can get the admins to do something about a problem account on the weekends is to call in a favor from someone I know who happens to be able to contact them directly. This site is rapidly becoming unmoddable and the admins ignoring us isn't helping. At all.

Will this data (or some anonymized version of it) be available to mods? This would be really helpful in determining whether a post is actually doing well or if it's being manipulated. 

<u/spez>: Right now, it's just in a test for a small sample of users. It's something we could consider, but we would do that in the context of considering the privacy implications as well. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/TheoryOfReddit>: Just noticed reddit is redirecting outgoing links through https://out.reddit.com - effectively monitoring them.

Is this a new "feature"? I just noticed it a few moments ago. It's the same behavior google uses to monitor what links you click on a search page. Not sure what to make of this. Any thoughts? Feel free to delete if this isn't suitable for TOR.

Edit:
[\[reddit change\] Rampdown of Outbound Click Events to add Privacy Controls](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4az6s1/reddit_change_rampdown_of_outbound_click_events/)

This will probably be an opt-in/opt-out feature in the future. For now this feature is not in being used anymore.

<u/spez>: Yes, we‚Äôre testing this.  The first thing we wanted to learn is what users click on globally (i.e. what our our most popular domains are. We have learned this. I‚Äôll give you one guess‚Ä¶). We‚Äôre only sampling over a small number of users. Down the road we‚Äôd like to use this information this data to make recommendations, fight spam, make better sorting algorithms, and improve the front page (e.g. not show you the same links over and over). The information isn‚Äôt being used on an individual basis, and before it is, we‚Äôll give you a way to clear your history. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: [Request] Implement reCAPCHA on the signup form

So, as we're all aware, there's a lot of porn spam lately. The spam filter and my automod config are thankfully catching all of them (They still however fill my modqueue).

Now, they really shouldn't be happening in the first place. I really feel that implementing reCAPCHA or a similar bot checking service to the site signup form could really help stop these spammers getting through in the first place, and would make it a lot easier for subreddits as a whole since they wouldn't have to deal with the ridiculous amount of bots. As it is currently, these bots seem to be getting past the old style capchas on the post pages just fine.

EDIT: It has been noted that the login capcha [was removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/2mlr1g/reddit_change_redesign_of_loginaccount_creation/cm5e78f), however the issues listed in that comment do not apply with reCAPCHA as it is simply a tickbox.

I have seen several Amazon links show up in the SPAM view and I am trying to figure out why.  The links do not have "tag=" which I understand indicate referral links.  I have checked AutoMod config and there is nothing there to trigger it.  The Automod is pretty sparse as is.

Here are two links that got thrown into SPAM.

My best guess is another Mod though "ref=" meant referral and tagged them some time ago.  And since the system "learns" it remembered it?  I don't know if that is the case, nor how to check or fix it if it is.

Or maybe it is something else I missed?

<u/love_the_heat>: Can you share anything with us any recent conversations about updating modmail?

<u/spez>: I've been pushing a strategy change to build modmail as a separate app on our api. Building things in our current desktop codebase is painfully slow because of all the tech debt.

That was the same reasoning for the modmail -> email experiment, which didn't work out that way I had hoped. (It's not completely dead, though. We're going to use it internally and iterate). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: Amazon links being flagged as SPAM.

<u/spez>: fixed <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/AlienBlue>: A New Chapter: Reddit for iOS

Hey everyone! I'm the product manager for our mobile apps here at Reddit. 

We wanted to give you an update on the state of Reddit for iOS, which some of you may have heard about in u/spez‚Äôs [most recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/). What started last year as a plan to update Alien Blue to make it bigger and better - grew into a much bigger project. We now have a beautiful, functional new app for iOS that we‚Äôre confident will be the best way to access Reddit content on your phone. 


That said, we know Alien Blue is loved by many as it is. And because this new app will be so different from what you now know as Alien Blue, we‚Äôve decided to make the new version into its own app (and sku) called Reddit. 


Alien Blue will continue to be available to its current users, but we‚Äôll be moving the team over to focus our energy on the new flagship app. As such, Alien Blue will be unavailable for download by new users once the new app is released.


The whole team here has been hard at work on this and we‚Äôre looking forward to sharing it with you. We‚Äôre beginning a closed beta test for the app in the next couple of weeks. As we did with Reddit for Android, we‚Äôre opening up sign-ups [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/46ge0j/sign_up_for_the_reddit_for_ios_mobile_beta/) so you can get early access and provide us with feedback before the app is open to the public. 


Thanks again for all your support. We know our Alien Blue users are some of our most passionate redditors, and we look forward to showing you what we‚Äôve got and working with you to make it even better. As a starting point, please comment below your favorite features of Alien Blue you‚Äôd like to see in the new app, and I‚Äôll work with the team to scope and prioritize them.


I‚Äôll be hanging out here in the comments to answer questions! 


<u/ShyHero>: Casual reddits and night mode are must haves. Gallery would be nice. 

But really zero chance I use the new version if it doesn't support casual reddits and night mode. 

<u/carcollectornj>: This. Night mode is an awesome feature!

We wanted to give you an update on the state of Reddit for iOS, which some of you may have heard about in u/spez‚Äôs [most recent AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/434h6c/reddit_in_2016/). What started last year as a plan to update Alien Blue to make it bigger and better - grew into a much bigger project. We now have a beautiful, functional new app for iOS that we‚Äôre confident will be the best way to access Reddit content on your phone. 


That said, we know Alien Blue is loved by many as it is. And because this new app will be so different from what you now know as Alien Blue, we‚Äôve decided to make the new version into its own app (and sku) called Reddit. 


Alien Blue will continue to be available to its current users, but we‚Äôll be moving the team over to focus our energy on the new flagship app. As such, Alien Blue will be unavailable for download by new users once the new app is released.


The whole team here has been hard at work on this and we‚Äôre looking forward to sharing it with you. We‚Äôre beginning a closed beta test for the app in the next couple of weeks. As we did with Reddit for Android, we‚Äôre opening up sign-ups [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/46ge0j/sign_up_for_the_reddit_for_ios_mobile_beta/) so you can get early access and provide us with feedback before the app is open to the public. 


Thanks again for all your support. We know our Alien Blue users are some of our most passionate redditors, and we look forward to showing you what we‚Äôve got and working with you to make it even better. As a starting point, please comment below your favorite features of Alien Blue you‚Äôd like to see in the new app, and I‚Äôll work with the team to scope and prioritize them.


I‚Äôll be hanging out here in the comments to answer questions! 


<u/spez>: I can't overstate how excited I am about this. I've been an Alien Blue user for many years‚Äìit's where I do 90% of my redditting‚Äìand u/jase (the author) is a genius. That said, the new app is looking dope. The new iOS team is FLYING. I can't wait for it to be in the hands of users (including me).

<u/itch0>: I hope /u/jase is still involved? The mobile reddit community owes him so much. The amount of effort he's poured into AlienBlue is incredible. 

<u/spez>: Yes, he's still with us. He's in Australia, and has limited availability, but he's working on the next AB release as we speak. Like I said, we think the world of him, and we'll take as much as we can get. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/AlienBlue>: A New Chapter: Reddit for iOS

Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, it‚Äôs a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit‚Äôs mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit‚Äôs communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and it‚Äôs important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

<u/reseph>: >to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators

As a moderator, I'm not really sure this happened. Look in /r/ModSupport which was suppose to be a communication channel between mods and admins. The majority of the topics (which are questions) have no admin response. I have a couple topics in there from weeks ago with no admin comment. I sent a modmail to that subreddit 7 days ago just asking if the subreddit was still planned to be a communication tool between us mods and admins. I never got a reply. I'm losing count of all the "having major spam issues" questions in /r/ModSupport that receive no admin reply; a single response would be enough. It seems to have fallen to as little admin participation as /r/modtalk gets.

I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.

A year ago, reddit hired a "Community Engineer" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this. Modmail is one of the most important things for us moderators; even having an acknowledge/resolved button would be fantastic.

/r/snoogaming (created by an admin) remains abandoned by the admins with us moderators trying to pick up the slack. I had to pull teeth like no tomorrow to get a basic answer on what the future of this was from an admin perspective. This was before you returned though I think.

I barely hear anything from the admins nowadays. I get replies on /r/reddit.com PMs when I contact them about ban evasion, but I got replies like that 2 years ago so things are as they were.

In the same light, AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water. There is an error topic [stickied](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/3zrckp/bug_i_am_getting_this_error_almost_daily_since/) and has been for 3 weeks. No fix nor admin comments in the last 20 days. Not only that, but with reddit.com owning the app now the admins developing that app don't seem to be staying on top of their own reddit changes. I don't believe the new subreddit rule system (which was in beta for a while) is even implemented on the app? And as a moderator, subreddit rules being front and center on mobile is very important to us. If reddit is developing a new system like that, don't you think it should be implemented into AlienBlue in parallel?

I'm not trying to pick on individual admins, scenarios or people. I am trying to show a pattern that is not changing. reddit is a *professional business*. It's very concerning.

There are good things, like the new subreddit rules system (although it's limited to 10 rules only) and sticky comments. But communication doesn't seem improved. It's not the end of the world, it's just things don't feel different outside new mod features.

<u/spez>: 3 of the top 10 posts in r/ModSupport are from us. I'm sorry we don't get to every question, but we're absolutely in there. We are very aware of the spam issues.

> I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.

You won't really. We've improved here, and we're continuing to invest in it, but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working.

> A year ago, reddit hired a "Community Engineer" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this.

I'm sad to say that although we invested quite a bit, my favorite feature [didn't work out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/42o57u/modmailtoemail_beta_closing/). I had thought by forwarding mail out of Reddit we could do an end-run around the problem. I was trying to avoid a wholesale rewrite of the system because that will take forever with our current resources. We're not doing nothing, but we haven't succeeded either. We're still on it.

> AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water.

We bought it years ago, actually, and have put out a number of releases in the past few months, [at least five](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue). We are working on a new iOS app as we speak, and that will be the future for us, but we're continuing to maintain AB during the meantime.

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. That's why we released the [better banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tools a couple months ago, which allows us to put a user in timeout with an explanation. This helps correct behavior.

Moderators can still ban users from their communities, and it's not transparent. I don't like this, and I get a lot of complaints from confused users. However, the moderators don't have a ton of alternatives. [Improving reporting with more rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/42o2i0/moderators_subreddit_rules_now_available_for_all/) is a step in the right direction. It's my desire that moderators will rely on banning less and less as we build better tooling.

<u/glr123>: Hi /u/Spez, can you comment on the criticism that Suspensions/Muting and the new tools have actually caused an increase in the animosity between users and moderators? In /r/science, this is a constant problem that we deal with. 

Muting users has done essentially the same thing as banning them has - it ultimately tells them their behavior is unacceptable, and encourages them to reach out in modmail to discuss the situation with us further. 90% of the time, this results in them sending hateful messages to use that are full of abuse. We are then told to mute them in modmail, and they are back in 72 hours to abuse us some more. We have gone to the community team to report these users, and are told completely mixed answers. In some cases, we are told that by merely messaging the user to stop abusing us in modmail, we are engaging them and thus nothing can be done. In other cases, we are told that since we didn't tell them to stop messaging us, nothing can be done.

You say that you want to improve moderator relations, but these new policies have only resulted in us fielding *more* abuse. It has gotten so bad in /r/science, that we have resorted to just banning users with automod and not having the automated reddit system send them any more messages, as the level of venomous comments in modmail has gotten too high to deal with. We have even recently had moderators receive death threats over such activities. This is the exact opposite scenario that you would wish to happen, but the policies on moderator abuse are so lax that we have had to take actions into our own hands.

How do you plan to fix this?

I barely hear anything from the admins nowadays. I get replies on /r/reddit.com PMs when I contact them about ban evasion, but I got replies like that 2 years ago so things are as they were.

In the same light, AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water. There is an error topic [stickied](https://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/3zrckp/bug_i_am_getting_this_error_almost_daily_since/) and has been for 3 weeks. No fix nor admin comments in the last 20 days. Not only that, but with reddit.com owning the app now the admins developing that app don't seem to be staying on top of their own reddit changes. I don't believe the new subreddit rule system (which was in beta for a while) is even implemented on the app? And as a moderator, subreddit rules being front and center on mobile is very important to us. If reddit is developing a new system like that, don't you think it should be implemented into AlienBlue in parallel?

I'm not trying to pick on individual admins, scenarios or people. I am trying to show a pattern that is not changing. reddit is a *professional business*. It's very concerning.

There are good things, like the new subreddit rules system (although it's limited to 10 rules only) and sticky comments. But communication doesn't seem improved. It's not the end of the world, it's just things don't feel different outside new mod features.

<u/spez>: 3 of the top 10 posts in r/ModSupport are from us. I'm sorry we don't get to every question, but we're absolutely in there. We are very aware of the spam issues.

> I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.

You won't really. We've improved here, and we're continuing to invest in it, but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working.

> A year ago, reddit hired a "Community Engineer" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this.

I'm sad to say that although we invested quite a bit, my favorite feature [didn't work out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/42o57u/modmailtoemail_beta_closing/). I had thought by forwarding mail out of Reddit we could do an end-run around the problem. I was trying to avoid a wholesale rewrite of the system because that will take forever with our current resources. We're not doing nothing, but we haven't succeeded either. We're still on it.

> AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water.

We bought it years ago, actually, and have put out a number of releases in the past few months, [at least five](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue). We are working on a new iOS app as we speak, and that will be the future for us, but we're continuing to maintain AB during the meantime.

 <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, it‚Äôs a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit‚Äôs mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit‚Äôs communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and it‚Äôs important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

<u/hatessw>: Reddit has a history of banning users rather opaquely, such as by means of the still well-known shadowban.

What will users see and not see during 2016 when the T&S team deems a user to have violated a rule?

<u/spez>: We added the [account suspension](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tool just for this purpose. Instead of shadowbanning, a user will be put in timeout with an explanation. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/K_Lobstah>: Obviously not everyone would agree, but I've been happy with the steady stream of new tools, fixes and features for moderating. So thank you and thank you to the team responsible for developing these tools, for sticking to your word on that.   
  
One thing I was curious about was the on-boarding process for new reddit accounts. At some point, this was a project being worked on by a few admins that involved a really snazzy looking UI with some basic info. However, I understand it was put on the back-burner to deal with the more imminent issues facing reddit admin (Blackout 2015 never5get).  
  
Will this come back into the pipeline at some point this year? I honestly believe that presenting a new user with even just a *brief* overview of basic reddit standards, rules, and etiquette would make a world of difference for everyone who uses the site on a daily (hourly, minutely?) basis.  
  


<u/spez>: > Will this come back into the pipeline at some point this year?

Very likely. As you said, we put it on the back burner because we had more acute pains to deal with. One of our big company goals this year is to increase engagement, and a great way of doing this is to convert our casual users into redditors, which requires education.

At this very moment, however, we're working on a few other things. Mobile is getting a lot of attention. That's where the users are going, whether we are prepared or not. The A/B testing system is critically important as well. This allows us to see if changes (e.g. to onboarding) are actually having the intended effect. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/mo-reeseCEO1>: there's been some recent anxiety about reddit attempting to monetize user posts through publishing. will there be a a policy addressing the kind of content that reddit might seek to publish and generate future revenue? or is it anything is up for grabs?

<u/spez>: Are you referring to the AMA book? That was a project started quite a while ago with the r/IAMA mods with the aim of making something physical and beautiful to show off in the real world. Proceeds from the book are going to charity, but we're still working with the charity on terms (yes, that's a thing we have to do).

But if you think our best revenue idea is *making a book*, I'm a little insulted. I mean, I know we have a lot to improve on, but we'd at least sell your personal data to advertisers before getting into publishing for profit. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/CatNamedBernie4Karma>: Would be nice to have some sort of accountability for *mods* who consistently *abuse* their positions, *especially when they do it for the sake of being able to do it in the first place.* (Looking at you, "Mr.666")

90% of them are great! In fact, I've not had any personal encounters myself that were anything other than respectful. I'm referring to some very, very toxic examples that can be seen sprinkled throughout the communities at any given time.

<u/spez>: I would say 99% of mods are great, but yes, there are some bad actors. We take the stance that the moderators can run their communities how they'd like, even if we'd do it differently in some cases.

Making it easier for new communities to grow will put more accountability on the established communities. When I refer to the front page algorithm work, this will be one of the side effects. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit‚Äôs communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and it‚Äôs important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

<u/kerovon>: It does seem like the Reddit community has become more bitter and divided, with some groups actively protesting against moderators and large communities. Do you have any plans to try to address the gap between groups like moderators and subredditcancer/undelete?

<u/spez>: > It does seem like the Reddit community has become more bitter and divided

I believe that's a side effect of our community broadening. As I mentioned elsewhere,  improving the front page algorithm and addressing the default situation will go a long way. We're seeing the effects of a bunch of people who have wildly differing viewpoints crammed into a small room.

My dear friend, first Reddit employee, and smartest guy on the planet, u/KeyserSosa, is hard at work on the problem.

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. That's why we released the [better banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tools a couple months ago, which allows us to put a user in timeout with an explanation. This helps correct behavior.

Moderators can still ban users from their communities, and it's not transparent. I don't like this, and I get a lot of complaints from confused users. However, the moderators don't have a ton of alternatives. [Improving reporting with more rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/42o2i0/moderators_subreddit_rules_now_available_for_all/) is a step in the right direction. It's my desire that moderators will rely on banning less and less as we build better tooling. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/fyreNL>: Hi Steve!

Could you explain a bit on what this Trust and Safety team is about and what they do?

Thanks for the update!

<u/spez>: The T&S team is mandated to do two things: make sure users don't see spam, and to enforce our policies.

Spam is fairly straightforward to explain. You shouldn't see it. Reporting helps, but the real solution involves investing in more automated tools. We'll never be able to solve the problem one spammer at a time.

Their second job is to enforce the [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). The better banning feature we released a couple months ago is helpful here. Now we have the ability to actually enforce behavior without outright banning someone, which doesn't really work.

This team is [hiring](https://www.reddit.com/jobs). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/duckvimes_>: As a mod, there's been a huge increase in spam lately. Reporting spammers via r/spam seems to be hit or miss, and it's not clear if there's any way to report entire spam domains (which would make everything so much easier). Modmails and username summons in r/spam usually go unanswered. 

You acknowledged that there's a spam problem, but what are you planning to actually do about it?

<u/spez>: We don't have the bandwidth to answer every summons, but we're aware of the uptick lately. Our efforts right now are to improve in a more scalable fashion. Historically, it's been a lot of one-offs and by-hand efforts, which isn't sustainable.

<u/[deleted]>: >We don't have the bandwidth to answer every summons

Reddit has a pretty small community team, improving that could also be a good step worth taking

<u/spez>: Yes. That's what I was referring with the T&S team. We basically had one small group of people trying to do everything. Going forward it'll be better to have teams focusing on specific areas. In this case, the Community team can focus on community, and the T&S team can focus on spam and abuse.

Now that 2015 is in the books, it‚Äôs a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit‚Äôs mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit‚Äôs communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is "Look Forward." Reddit has a long history, and it‚Äôs important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

So in a community where a lot of debate and back and forth happen how do you feel you will be able to separate abuse and threats vs hot headed argumentative people who can't seem to just hug it out?

<u/spez>: There are gray areas for sure, but there are also many cases where unacceptable behavior is clearly unacceptable. We're focusing on those first. Repeatedly hammering someone over PMs, for example, is an easy one. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/duckvimes_>: As a mod, there's been a huge increase in spam lately. Reporting spammers via r/spam seems to be hit or miss, and it's not clear if there's any way to report entire spam domains (which would make everything so much easier). Modmails and username summons in r/spam usually go unanswered. 

You acknowledged that there's a spam problem, but what are you planning to actually do about it?

<u/spez>: We don't have the bandwidth to answer every summons, but we're aware of the uptick lately. Our efforts right now are to improve in a more scalable fashion. Historically, it's been a lot of one-offs and by-hand efforts, which isn't sustainable. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Reddit in 2016

<u/ChrisSlicks>: Hi Steve, are there any plans in place to deal with the server overload that occurs during peak hours?

<u/spez>: Yes. We're making steady progress. We've made a couple of solid new hires on that team as well. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

In a little over a month we‚Äôll be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it‚Äôs shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. I‚Äôll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

This was a statement in the old policy I never liked because it's vague as to what is actually personally identifiable.

<u/eberkneezer>: A quick glance

**New policy**

> How We Use Information About You :    **Personalize the Services and provide advertisements**, content and features that match user profiles or interests.


> We will not share, sell, or give away any of our users‚Äô personal information to third parties, unless one of the following circumstances applies:  Except as it relates to advertisers and our ad partners, **we may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers** who need access to such information to carry out work for us


**Old policy**

> While advertisers may target their ads to the topic of a given subreddit or based on your IP address, we do not sell or otherwise give access to any information collected about our users to any third party.

---

So it looks like you are going to be profiling users in order to advertise to them.  The old system had advertising based on the profile of the subreddit and not the users.  It also looks like you are sharing/selling  information with your advertisers.

Sounds like the changes to the privacy policy is to allow the creepy annoying advertising.  The type that makes adblocking popular.

<u/spez>: We're still not selling or giving access to individual user data. That is important to us, and we state in the privacy we won't do this. ("This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers.")

We would like to allow advertisers to target on more than just communities, however. For example, targeting based on keywords will be helpful‚Äìthere is a lot gaming content on Reddit outside of communities dedicate specifically to gaming. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

<u/spez>: That's correct. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

In a little over a month we‚Äôll be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it‚Äôs shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. I‚Äôll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

This can't be emphasized enough. This should be a required class in high school (or maybe even elementary school, IMO). 

I've met too many people who think they're being tracked illegally when in reality they just don't understand how their browsers work. 

Thanks for being proactive in documenting changes to the privacy policy and keeping your users informed. Other tech companies could take a hint from you. 

<u/spez>: Right, we only see what's given to us. Personal responsibility is important in all of this.

One of our responsibilities is to educate users on what control they actually have, which is quite a bit. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

<u/_hai>: If all that has changed in the Privacy Policy is the IP retention span I don't have a problem with this. For all the complaining done about censorship etc (which I agree with) Reddit has had a stellar record to date of maintaining user privacy.

 Keep up the good work!

<u/DoorMarkedPirate>: Out of curiosity, why aren't the IP addresses encrypted and hashed already?  I imagine usernames and passwords are already treated like that, so is it to computationally intensive to do so with IP addresses because dynamic ones change so frequently?  Or is it because you need them for location tracking?

<u/phyzome>: There's no point in hashing IP addresses -- it's such a small search space, an attacker would be able to reverse the hash in hours.

Encryption (using symmetric ciphers, or an asymmetric cipher where the "public" key is just as well protected as the private key) would only allow you to compare addresses for abuse prevention if the initialization vector or similar is constant, which decreases the protection of the encryption!

I'm sure someone could come up with a scenario where this is useful, but I can't think of one off the top of my head.

<u/spez>: > There's no point in hashing IP addresses -- it's such a small search space, an attacker would be able to reverse the hash in hours.

Our thinking is to hash with a salt and throw away the salts periodically. For abuse, we mostly care about "is this IP the same?"  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

<u/theozzy>: Good job Reddit for being one of the only big websites to give a fuck about their user's privacy. I don't think people give Reddit enough credit for this kind of stuff.

Edit: thanks for the gold!

<u/spez>: A lot of people around here appreciate you saying that. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: We are updating our Privacy Policy (effective Jan 1, 2016)

In a little over a month we‚Äôll be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it‚Äôs shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

<u/spez>: Also, thank you u/orangejulius and u/courtiebabe420 for reading drafts of the Policy! <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions!

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: I've answered this a couple times here and there.

Any engineer should want to work at reddit for a variety of reasons:

* You get to work on interesting problems (scaling, abuse, search, data, ML, mobile)
* Your work will be seen by millions of people
* Your work will affect the lives of millions on people
* You get to work with smart people in a fun environment
* We have really generous benefits. Full health, dental, vision. We pay for parking, gyms, daycare, and a bunch of other random stuff.

As for no negotiation, we had a similar policy at Hipmunk, and it worked well. I think my reasoning might be different from Ellen's. The reason I like it is because many people are not good at negotiating, or just don't like it. We do our best to ensure comp is fair both internally and externally. A critical part of this policy is that we *always make our best offer up front*. That way, if someone comes back to us and asks for more, we can say "no" with a clear conscience. I have found in practice this is almost never required.

We're in the business of getting the best people we can, not the best people for as cheap as possible. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

<u/The_Potato_God99>: What is your opinion on free speech today?

Do you still believe shadowbanning should be reserved to spammer? If so, how are you going to change the current system?

do you agree with the statement "Subreddits should be banned if they make reddit look bad, even if they are technically legal."?

Does reddit thinks about adding a "nsfl" button?

Finally, I have a suggestion for subreddits that are "weird" and make reddit look bad (I am not talking about subs that have CP or other illegal things in them). There should be an option when creating a subreddit to tag it as "NSFL" and/or "Contains potentially offensive content", just like there is an option to make every post "NSFW". These subs would never appear in /r/All and there could be a warning when entering the sub just like with "NSFW".

What do you think?

<u/spez>: > What is your opinion on free speech today?

It's important to both our society and to Reddit, and both inside and outside of Reddit it's an incredibly complex issue. My position as it relates to Reddit is that we try to let as much go as possible because it's important to have a realistic view of the world. I believe in many ways that Reddit is the online reflection of humanity, and we want to preserve that. However, we also feel obligated to take steps to prevent real-world harm to people and to protect Reddit itself. Often, this puts us in a position of having to make some very difficult decisions.

> do you agree with the statement "Subreddits should be banned if they make reddit look bad, even if they are technically legal."?

No, but the inverse isn't true either.

> Does reddit thinks about adding a "nsfl" button?

Yes. That was an alternative name suggestion to quarantining, incidentally. Our work isn't done in this department.

> What do you think?

Totally on board. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions!

<u/Plorp>: Is there any chance you guys are ever going to take a look at the [10% rule for self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and revise it a bit to make it more fair to creative people who legitimately have something to share to the reddit community? I ask because I know that rule is turning a lot of creative people away from reddit because recently any posts about what they're currently working on tend to get deleted. There's a difference between spamming 100 links to a blog nobody cares about full of ads, and say, an indie game developer who makes 1 game every couple of years and wants to tell people about it and answer questions, but doesnt necessarily want to have to post 10 advice animals in the mean time?

This isn't my main account, its just the one I post on the most because I don't really want reddit posts on my other account showing up in google searches for my name. SO I just use the other one to talk about stuff I'm working on (not spam, one post once in a while and when they don't get deleted for self promotion they get upvoted a lot and people seem to enjoy them and I answer questions and participate in the discussions). Or I used to at least. It's been difficult lately.

At least there seems to be quite a double standard where anyone SUPER FAMOUS AND POPULAR already gets a free pass for promoting their works on reddit (celebrity AMAs and people like JimKB), whereas all the little guys who can't afford massive marketing campaigns for their works get shunned away and basically told that reddit doesn't value their work. I'm [not the only one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv5UjfCZUzg) who thinks this.

If you want specific complaints about the 10% rule its:  
- comments don't count  
- posts from many years ago before this rule was strict count against it  
- posts in subreddits that WANT original content and posts from creators (like /r/gamedev) count against you in all other subreddits  
- posts on alternate accounts don't count (I like keeping my "business" account separated since I don't want people to easily see like, my political opinions and stuff)  
- the rule just encourages people to either spam up advice animals, or lie about being the author ("my friend just made..."), or use sockpuppet accounts. All of these seem less valuable to me than letting authors be honest about it, and it makes reddit a worse place as a result.  
- A spambot or true spammer can get around a rule like "90% of posts must not be self promotion" with bots and scripts and proxies and sockpuppets really easily, so this rule just ends up targeting honest creatives who are proud of what they made and want to share it with a site they visit every day.

Perhaps you could expand the New York office or set up shop in Silicon Alley outside of Boston?

<u/spez>: We have a small presence in NYC, mostly for ad sales, though.

<u/hansjens47>: #1:

/r/redditrequest was added as a stopgap measure 5 years ago.

Currently someone can squat on large and active subreddit communities without any involvement in that subreddit whatsoever, as long as they log into their account once every 2 months.

* **What would it take for the admins to look at new procedures for removing inactive and unresponsive moderators who aren't part of the communities they're supposed to act on behalf of?**

---

#2:

When the default set of subreddits was changed to encompas 50 subreddits a year or so ago, rather than about 25, the promise was that changes could be made more often to ensure that things stay fresh, and that reddit is an interesting website also for those who don't have accounts.

I think that was at least in part a response to how overdue the un-defaulting of subreddits like /r/politics, /r/adviceanimals and /r/atheism took place. The longer a community is a default and passively builds up users even if mods are failing at running the community, the harder it is to fix those problems afterwards.

* **What would it take to look at the current default subreddits and potential changes to them?**


(corollary: geodefualts don't seem to have received any support in the last year or so either. Are they technically still in beta?) 


---

#3: 

The 2014 US midterm election wasn't covered in the default subreddits. That means that to follow US politics on reddit you have to have an account. A large proportion of redditors don't. 

For a site that takes a stance on political issues like marriage equality and an open and free internet, it seems strange that not all users are exposed to that content, even if it's the regional politics of the location you're in (geodefaults).

* **What would it take to cover the 2016 US presidential election in the defaults in some way?** 

<u/spez>: 1. It's something we discuss somewhat regularly around here. We all agree it's a problem. It's not our largest problem at the moment, but we will address it.

2. I don't think the notion of blessing a specific set of communities is sustainable. It requires too much intervention on our side, and it also prevents new communities from breaking into popularity because they hit the "default ceiling". I'm looking forward to tackling this.

3. We don't control the content of the defaults, so it's largely up to them. We do work with them from time to time on more "event"-like situations. For example, if we have connections to a prominent candidate, we can help find them a place on Reddit.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

<u/PikachuSnowman>: What happened to the promise that some of reddit's profits were going to be distributed back to the members in some way?

<u/spez>: We're still maintaining that stock for this purpose. The challenge is the mechanism through which we distribute it, and when. There are many legal and tax implications that need to be worked through. I'm sad to say we haven't spent a ton of time on it since I've returned other than to reaffirm, that yes, we are going to do it.

Because I don't anticipate a liquidity event for a while (nor are we profitable), we don't have anything to distribute, so we're not in a huge rush. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

<u/spez>: I alluded to this in another comment. In addition to better tools, making it easier for new communities to grow will help, a new front page algorithm is a big first step in this direction.

update: I can't tell if everyone disagrees, or if I wasn't clear, so I'll try again. I think the best solution to overzealous mods is to make it easier to create new communities under new leadership. The mods basically have one blunt tool right now, automoderator, and not a lot of time. Our first step is to provide better tooling for mods to enforce their own rules, and better defenses against abusive users. When all of this is combined, I expect far fewer abuses. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

<u/[deleted]>: Anything to say about the servers, more specifically about improving them? 

Errors are way too often.

<u/spez>: One of our major priorities this quarter is to stabilize the infrastructure. We're making progress, but we still have a ways to go.

<u/IAMAVelociraptorAMA>: Can you be _any_ more specific at all other than just "stabilize the infrastructure; making progress"?

I'm glad you've addressed it but what does that mean exactly - just more servers?  Changing how reddit works so that there's less stress on the servers somehow?  Buying more cloud service from Amazon?  Just bug-fixing?

If you can't say, that's fine, and I appreciate you answering the question at all, but _any_ kind of detail at all would go a very long way.

<u/spez>: It's not just adding more servers. The specific short-term fixes involve looking for optimizations in code and addressing some glaring infrastructure issues: improving our internal caching, for example.

Longer term, we'll rewrite everything, one piece at a time. Organizing the rest of our stack so this is possible is the first step. We need to get to more of a [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

<u/Shrinks99>: Has the new system of quarantining subreddits worked as you hoped it would?  Do you think it improves the way reddit is viewed in the public eye?

EDIT: /u/IpMedia brings up a good point.  Do advertisers want to buy more adspace on reddit now that this system is in place?

<u/spez>: Hard to measure, but yes, I think so. It's a lot harder to cherry-pick toxic, yet vanishingly small, communities to vilify Reddit.

<u/spez>: Still working on it! Testing new stuff next week, I believe. It's a multi-part plan: first, we need to provide alternatives to shadowbanning. We're working on these now. It's worth noting the admins (Reddit employees) and moderators (Reddit users) have different tools, both inadequate. Second, we need to get everyone comfortable (admins, moderators, users) with new tools (basically, non shadowban enforcement). Third, we need to make it easier for new communities to grow.

<u/LintGrazOr8>: I just want to ask. Is there any specific direction you guys want reddit to head towards? I see things like the Upvoted but I'm not entirely sure how it's supposed to be useful for me as a redditor. I guess I'm just asking what your plans are. Thanks!

<u/spez>: Right, Upvoted is really aimed at non-redditors. The goal is to show more people all the cool stuff that happens on Reddit every day, and hopefully bring more people into our communities.

Our short term plans I've talked about a lot: release proper mobile apps, mod/community tools, stabilize infrastructure, hire, hire hire.

<u/Rebelius>: Why is the front page so slow to update now? I used to come here for breaking news, now a shooting doesn't show up on the front page until the next day.

<u/spez>: We need to update constants in the hot algorithm, but after the the mistake we made a couple months ago (We were fixing another bug and unintentionally affected the front page. It's since been reverted, but that's what got this conversation started.), we want to make sure we test things better. In order to do that, we need to rebuild the testing infrastructure for the front page, which is nearly finished.

Longer-term, we've outgrown the current algorithm and need to devise a new one. We've got a lot of ideas here. It's just a matter of time / engineers. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: CEO Steve here to answer more questions.

<u/spez>: We've been investigating this for the past couple of weeks. The short story is nothing has actually changed on our end[1], and it really does appear to be the case that everyone is suddenly more sensitive to front-page turnover.

That said, we used to tweak constants in the hot algorithm as traffic grew, but we haven't done that in a while. Before we make any changes (big or small), we're testing them internally.

[1] We did make a change a while ago to fix a different issue, but we reverted it because it had unintended side-effects.

edit: I'm as skeptical as you all are that there isn't a change‚Äìthat's why we're investigating it‚Äìwe just haven't found a solid explanation yet.

<u/redikulous>: I find that hard to believe, I've been using this site for almost 6 years and have never seen such stagnation on the front page. It must be something you are overlooking. 

<u/[deleted]>: That, coupled with the fact that they're pushing for more celebrity engagement, advertising, etc. I think we're being straight up lied to.

Spez can't really come out and say, "We've been changing the site to cater to advertisers instead of users."

<u/spez>: That makes no sense. We have two ad placements: sponsored links at the top and display ads on the right. Neither are affected by the hot algorithm. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/technology>: Reddit Admits Its Front Page Is Broken, Is Working on an Entirely New Algorithm

Hello mods! We‚Äôve expanded our Community Management team, and I have two exciting announcements for you.

First, we‚Äôve hired a new Community Manager to help with the day to day duties, improving community communication, and overall engagement. /u/sodypop, a long time redditor and moderator, packed with tons of institutional knowledge of the site, has joined the reddit team officially!

Why is this being posted in /r/ModSupport, you ask?

Well, the second announcement is that we‚Äôve hired another Community Manager, /u/redtaboo, who will not only be helping with day to day community management duties, communication, and engagement, but will also be replacing me in my brief tenure as **Moderator Advocate**! This means that she'll be your new point of contact for moderator-specific issues. She'll be available to answer questions in here and in other moderator subreddits, and reply to modmail here if you have questions or ideas you don't want to post publicly. Remember, /r/reddit.com modmail and contact@reddit.com are still your go-to channels for general reports!

We‚Äôre very excited to have these two on board, so please join us in welcoming them to the team!

<u/kerovon>: I think you forgot to give the name of the second CM you hired.

<u/redtaboo>: It's still a secret. :|

Aaaarr-arahahhraarrrr.  That‚Äôs Wookie for ‚ÄúHello again, hope you‚Äôre doing well, AMAE (ask me anything engineering), aaarrhhuu-uhh‚Äù,

I‚Äôm back to chat [as promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3hs3v4/im_marty_weiner_the_new_reddit_cto/).  It‚Äôs already been a month and a wild ride the whole time.  I‚Äôve really gotten to know this amazing team and where we need to head (apparently there‚Äôs lots to do here‚Ä¶ who knew?).

Here‚Äôs a few updates:

* I‚Äôm still [surprisingly photogenic](http://imgur.com/G7G9BRK)
* R2‚Äôs legs [have made progress](http://i.imgur.com/zz0OeFz.jpg) (glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he‚Äôd agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to ‚Äúescape velocity‚Äù ‚Äî meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely "super highest priority".

Finally, yes, it‚Äôs true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.

I have about 1.17 hours now to answer questions, and then I'm going and playing with my wee ones.

Edit: Running to my train.  If I can get a seat, I'll finish off some in-flight answers.  XOXOXO, Marty

<u/spez>: The big feature we lack right now is keyword targeting, and perhaps more importantly, anti-keyword targeting. Right now, advertisers have very little control over who actually sees their ads because they can only target at the community level, and they're very concerned about brand safety. Basically, they want to say, I want my ad to show around conversations about *this* topic, but not *that* topic.

As far as tracking, we will continue to serve ads in an iframe, which dramatically limits what information an advertiser sees (e.g. they don't see what urls you're on), and we will provide ways to opt-out (more than we offer now).

Philosophically, I'm as paranoid as anyone about advertisers knowing what I'm up to online‚Äìit's a common characteristic of most Reddit employees, in fact‚Äìso that guides our thinking.

<u/verdatum>: /u/spez, I've genuinely been impressed of the changes that I've seen since you took over.  (and I will happily go on record that I never bore ill will towards Ellen Pao; she did fine by me) but much of the excellent input from yourself, and from the other admins have frequently fallen under the upvote radar.

I'm very glad that I have the ability to lookup admins by username and read through recent comments.  Doing this, I have often learned pieces of the story that I would have otherwise missed out upon.

Part of me wishes this wasn't the case; that I didn't have to go through the list of big players on Reddit to learn what has been going on; what "official" statements have been made. But at the same time, I don't know if I have any suggestions on how to improve this concern.

As often is the case with these burgeoning online communities, the more time that passes, the more difficult it can become to outsiders to understand and become aware of the political details involved.  This can risk closing off the community, which is contrary to the ideals of social networking.

I hate to be one to just point out problems without offering solutions; but I don't know if I have terribly good solutions.  I don't know if I'm such a major demographic, but I suppose I would like to see a centralized place, that regularly tracks the activity of these sort of accounts, and gives an account of what details have been revealed. And then have that place well advertised to users, while at the same time not coming off as spammy and propaganda; just a neutral accounting of what's new.  This wouldn't be easy, but I, for one at least, feel such a thing would be useful to get out a clear narrative.

Thanks for doing what you do. Similar to PotUSA, I wouldn't take on such a task for the world.

<u/spez>: Thanks for the kind words. Your suggestion is something to think about. Honestly, it would be helpful for me as well. A lot has changed over the years... <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Marty Weiner, Reddit CTO, back to CTO all the things

<u/spez>: The big feature we lack right now is keyword targeting, and perhaps more importantly, anti-keyword targeting. Right now, advertisers have very little control over who actually sees their ads because they can only target at the community level, and they're very concerned about brand safety. Basically, they want to say, I want my ad to show around conversations about *this* topic, but not *that* topic.

As far as tracking, we will continue to serve ads in an iframe, which dramatically limits what information an advertiser sees (e.g. they don't see what urls you're on), and we will provide ways to opt-out (more than we offer now).

Philosophically, I'm as paranoid as anyone about advertisers knowing what I'm up to online‚Äìit's a common characteristic of most Reddit employees, in fact‚Äìso that guides our thinking.

<u/goatcoat>: So basically, you want Prego to be able to show pasta sauce ads on posts about spaghetti, but prevent them from showing on posts about abortion.

Aaaarr-arahahhraarrrr.  That‚Äôs Wookie for ‚ÄúHello again, hope you‚Äôre doing well, AMAE (ask me anything engineering), aaarrhhuu-uhh‚Äù,

I‚Äôm back to chat [as promised](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3hs3v4/im_marty_weiner_the_new_reddit_cto/).  It‚Äôs already been a month and a wild ride the whole time.  I‚Äôve really gotten to know this amazing team and where we need to head (apparently there‚Äôs lots to do here‚Ä¶ who knew?).

Here‚Äôs a few updates:

* I‚Äôm still [surprisingly photogenic](http://imgur.com/G7G9BRK)
* R2‚Äôs legs [have made progress](http://i.imgur.com/zz0OeFz.jpg) (glue is drying AS WE TYPE)
* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he‚Äôd agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to ‚Äúescape velocity‚Äù ‚Äî meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

<u/ColdstreamRed>: What're the plans with the iOS interface? Are we going to see a major revamp, or are you sticking with the diagonal 'theme'?

<u/spez>: Major UI revamp is underway with, amongst many things, more traditional navigation.

(You can also enable Classic UI mode in AlienBlue settings, which is what I personally do for the time being). <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/AskReddit>: Are less people using reddit since the whole Pao debacle? Why is the front page the same since last night?

[removed]

<u/spez>: First, traffic is higher than ever. We're considering a more consistent CEO change schedule as a result. Stay tuned.

The front page algo is the same as it has been for the past while (year? more?), with the exception of a couple weeks ago when we started fiddling with it. We often fiddle with the constants in the algo to make sure there is fresh content on the front page, but the change last week didn't work right. It's back to the way it was before. As traffic grows, front page behavior changes. So, while the algo is the same, the content very well might be aging differently from what you've been used to (we haven't measured it yet). 

My suspicion is that it isn't much different than before, just that people are more sensitive to it. That doesn't mean there isn't an issue, but rather that there has been an issue for longer than you might think.

All that said, the front page algorithm is something I'd like to spend time on sooner rather than later. I've got a bunch of ideas for improvement. Given our resources at the moment, it's going to be a bit until we get to it, so we'll look for short-term fixes in the meantime.

<u/Goonred>: Web Archive has Sept. 13 front page with posts nearing 24hrs still up top. 

Surely there's something wrong there? Not even when you guys changed the capping it was that bad.

<u/spez>: Certainly not ideal. Hence, my desire to improve the algorithm.

We're seeing two things here (at least): the effects of the the disparity between the number of votes on the front page versus community pages, and the effects of the disparity between the number of votes on a Friday versus the weekend. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/AskReddit>: Are less people using reddit since the whole Pao debacle?

Oh haaaii!  Just made this new Reddit account to party with everybody.

A little about myself:

* I‚Äôm [incredibly photogenic](http://imgur.com/4mZR3Jt)
* I love building.  Love VLSI, analog/digital circuitry, microarchitecture, assembly, OS design, network design, VM/JIT, distributed systems, ios/android/web, 3d modeling/animation/rendering.  Recently got into 3d printing - fucking LOVE it.  My 3d printer enables me to make nearly anything and have it materialize on my desk in a few hours. 
* I love people.  When I first became a manager, I discovered how amazing the human mind really is and endeavoured to learn everything I can.  I love studying the relationship between our limbic and rational selves, how communication breaks down, what motivates people / teams, and how to build amazing cultures.  I‚Äôm currently learning everything I can about what constitutes a strong company culture and trying to make the discussion of culture more rigorous than it currently is in the valley.
* My current non-Reddit projects are making a grocery list iOS app that‚Äôs super simple and just does the right thing (trying out App Engine for backend).  And the other is making this full size fully functional [thing](http://imgur.com/A41GI6o).

I‚Äôm suuuuper excited to be here!  I don‚Äôt know much at all yet (I‚Äôve been an official employee for‚Ä¶ 7 hours?), but I plan to do an AMA in 30 days (Sept 20ish) once I know a lot more.  I‚Äôll try to answer whatever questions I can, but I may have to punt on some of them.  I gots an hour at the moment, then will go home and change diapers, then answer more as time permits.

If you are interested in joining our engineering team, please head over to [reddit.com/jobs](https://www.reddit.com/jobs). We are in the market for engineers of all shapes and sizes: frontend, backend, data, ops, anything in between!

Edit: And I'm off to my train to diaper land.  Let's do this again in 30 days!  Love you!

<u/spez>: When I first arrived back at Reddit, one of the first things I learned is that we were in desperate need for more technical leadership, and the first person we reached out to was Marty. He has the perfect combination of qualities we want in a CTO: [He has impressive technical chops](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Pinterest); experience growing a team through many phases (taking Pinterest from 2 to 300 engineers); very thoughtful opinions on company culture (but don‚Äôt ask him about them unless you‚Äôve got some time); and a long history on Reddit (he may replace his brother [Zach](https://www.reddit.com/u/mrweiner) as the most significant Weiner).

<u/sh4rkbait>: Would you say the fact that his name is Weiner had the most or the absolute most influence in you choosing him?

<u/spez>: Of course we want to earn money‚Äìthat's how businesses continue to exist‚Äìbut that didn't factor into our decision here.

The issue in this case is we faced the dilemma of either banning content in specific regions or having Reddit blocked entirely in these regions. Unfortunately, there isn't a middle ground in this case.

While we believe government censorship of the Internet is wrong (not to mention futile), we also need to make practical decisions to ensure Reddit is accessible to as many people as possible around the entire world.



<u/xstreamReddit>: There is absolutely zero chance of Reddit getting banned in Germany. We don't even have a system in place to do this here. The absolute worst that could happen is that you are placed on a blacklist which probably will prompt Google and other search engines to delist you.

<u/spez>: That's not true. We need to maintain relationships with governments worldwide so we continue to have an opportunity to review these issues on a case-by-case basis.

edit (mostly in response to your comment below, but expanding on this point):

As Reddit grows internationally, relationships with governments beyond our own in the United States become relevant.

<u/xstreamReddit>: That is equally true an irrelevant the BPjM is not the government and does not have any power to ban Reddit.  
Also the lack of transparancy is disturbing, the original post in /r/ChillingEffects didn't even state who issued this request (actually BPjM hasn't even been confirmed), what kind of material it was about, how it was determined that it is actually a valid complaint and why it was decided that the whole subreddit should be banned.  
And yes you should publish these things for each and every request.

<u/spez>: While I don't have much interest in debating you on irrelevant points, you're just plain wrong.

<u/xstreamReddit>: I know what the BPjM is (I am German btw) it just isn't the same as the government. The decisions they make are fairly independent and still they have no power to actually ban something from the internet.

It's an extremely slippery slope and you guys are really sliding more down hill than making an effort to climb up....

<u/ZineZ>: Websites such as reddit often end up being information hubs in times of public uprisings/protests in countries. Are you planning on adhering to every takedown request? And if not, how are you going to distinguish between what should be censored/kept?

This is an INCREDIBLY slippery slope and if you're going to continue to do so, there needs to be some way for you to publish what you're banning and when. 

<u/spez>: No, we consider each request on a case-by-case basis.

I don't want to get stuck considering too many hypotheticals, but I will entertain this one. If a government wants to ban Reddit entirely because we're the center of an uprising, there's nothing we can do to stop them. However, if they send us a takedown request for specific content, and give us a chance to consider it, we will absolutely take into account the greater context of what's going on.

We've published transparency reports in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/technology>: Reddit is now censoring posts and communities on a country-by-country basis

<u/TheChickening>: Reddit is not the freedom fighter you want it to be. It's a company that wants to earn money.

<u/spez>: Of course we want to earn money‚Äìthat's how businesses continue to exist‚Äìbut that didn't factor into our decision here.

Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.

<u/BillW87>: For the sake of transparency I feel like it would be best to make the list of banned communities public. With all of the concerns lately about the admins not being transparent enough, banning subs without telling us who they are seems counterproductive.

<u/Shintao6>: Changing the conversation away from CT and SRS for a minute, why were Loli subs banned? They produce no illegal content or anything that violates the new Content Policy. They do not harass, threaten or worsen anyone's Redditing experience. I was fully expecting a quarantine, and would have been fine with that. I understand and respect that Loli is not everyone's cup of tea. I also get that it's your show and we play by your rules, but can we get the rule written down somewhere at least?

<u/illegal_deagle>: Unfortunately it looks like SRS will continue to enjoy their harassment and downvote brigading. 


Edit: Come on, guys. I make a comment about downvote brigading and y'all mass downvote /u/spez for actually responding when he didn't have to. 

<u/spez>: For the the time being we believe that brigading is best fought with technology, which we are actively working on.

<u/[deleted]>: >For the the time being we believe that brigading is best fought with technology, which we are actively working on.

What does that mean exactly?

<u/spez>: It means that we can see downvoting brigades in that data, and we are working on preventing them from working. We used to do this in the past, and it worked quite well.

<u/[deleted]>: [deleted]

<u/spez>: We take banning **very** seriously. I believe we can combat negative actions like theirs by improving our own technology without banning them, so that is what we'll try first. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

<u/raldi>: I'm sure some of you are rushing to find [the Imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/FVJfxB5.png) about how ripping out someone's tongue doesn't prove them wrong, and that the real answer is to engage them in debate.

But it doesn't really apply, because nobody's tongue was ripped out. [The bigots have already migrated](https://voat.co/v/coontown) to another site, and they're doing just fine.

Shockingly, it doesn't look like the conversation going on over there in any way resembles an intellectually-honest debate on racial issues.

<u/spez>: It's more than that, even. We take banning very seriously, which is why it takes so long for us to do it. In this case, a small group of people were causing on outsized amount of harm to Reddit.

<u/kopkaas2000>: You're probably getting flooded with questions about this, but would you be willing to elaborate on the harm they were causing? As big as my distaste for racist bigots is, there's a strong narrative going on that they weren't breaking any rules / weren't harassing other users / were staying on their own shitty little island.

If you in fact just want to get rid of racist subs, it seems to me that just being clear on the issue would work out better. If it was indeed about rulebreaking, some more information would put the "they did nothing wrong"-narrative, and the implication of capricious justice, to bed.


<u/spez>: We didn't ban them for being racist. We banned them because we have to spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with them. If we want to improve Reddit, we need more people, but CT's existence and popularity has also made recruiting here more difficult.

<u/TheoryOfSomething>: Honestly then it sounds like you need to update your content policy again because nothing about what you said just now is reflected in your updated policy.

You banned them because they cause you problems, so why not just make that the standard? It'd at least be honest.

<u/spez>: That is what I meant by "While participating, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind this value above all others: show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is," which is in the opening statement of the Policy. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

<u/Xet>: Regarding Quarantining: Would you ever quarantine a large subreddit like /r/wtf?

> A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when we deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor.

One could argue that the very gorey types of pictures (edit: and videos, like of people dying) that appear on /r/wtf would be pretty upsetting. I know I've accidentally clicked on /r/wtf images when I temporarily disabled my own RES filters, and honestly of all things on the site, some of the stuff there is more troubling to me than discriminatory self text posts.

<u/spez>: No, because the mods of r/wtf are generally good about tagging things as NSFW.

<u/Xet>: As a furtherance to that, what if a quarantined subreddit then just made all posts nsfw by default? Would the quarantine be removed?

<u/spez>: We considered this. That was the status quo, but it wasn't working. By making it more difficult to access, we can slow the negative feedback loop of: have heinous content, attract more people to contribute heinous content, Reddit becomes known more for heinous content than all the amazing stuff it does for the world. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

Which communities have been banned?

<u/spez>: Today we removed communities dedicated to animated CP and a handful of other communities that violate the spirit of the policy by making Reddit worse for everyone else: /r/CoonTown, /r/WatchNiggersDie, /r/bestofcoontown, /r/koontown, /r/CoonTownMods, /r/CoonTownMeta.

<u/Delphizer>: This doesn't look like a comprehensive list, and even if you constantly updated it here, it seems there should be some place that lists what subreddits have been banned and quarantined and what rules they broke. Transparency and all that.

**EDIT 1** : As this picked up steam really fast, my "I totally know what I'm doing and know more than the CEO" off cuff suggestion is to output the database you use for the bans somewhere, this should be an auto updating real time list of bans, it's my understanding from minutes of web coding experience this should be fairly straightforward. :P

Maybe not top priority but I've seen a few call outs for something like that in many comments in many posts and it's largely been ignored. I'm assuming as it's been ignored the agreement is such a place won't exist. A comment one way or another would be appreciated.

<u/spez>: When something gets banned the mods often attempt to recreate the same communities, which we try and stay on top of, so it's an ongoing process today. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox.

<u/raldi>: I'm sure some of you are rushing to find [the Imgur link](http://i.imgur.com/FVJfxB5.png) about how ripping out someone's tongue doesn't prove them wrong, and that the real answer is to engage them in debate.

But it doesn't really apply, because nobody's tongue was ripped out. [The bigots have already migrated](https://voat.co/v/coontown) to another site, and they're doing just fine.

Shockingly, it doesn't look like the conversation going on over there in any way resembles an intellectually-honest debate on racial issues.

<u/spez>: It's more than that, even. We take banning very seriously, which is why it takes so long for us to do it. In this case, a small group of people were causing on outsized amount of harm to Reddit. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

<u/Teh_Compass>: Quarantining is a good step from outright banning. But banning more subreddits in addition to that isn't going to solve anything.

Banning subreddits that break the TOS like harassing users and such makes sense, but you can't go and ban subreddits that don't, no matter how much people don't like them.

/r/fatpeoplehate, for example, was annoying to people but could easily be ignored. It didn't need to be banned initially. But I totally understand that it was banned for the brigading it did. I was subscribed to one of the subreddits that was being brigaded and its users harassed.

/r/coontown, for example is easily ignored and doesn't deserve to be banned, even if they are racist as shit. I hear rumors about brigading but I personally don't know enough about it. If there is evidence that they are doing something like that then by all means ban them. But just because you don't agree with them doesn't mean they should be banned.

You essentially run the site and can do whatever you want. But remember what the users want.

<u/spez>: We didn't ban them because we disagree with them. We banned them because this exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else.  <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

<u/illegal_deagle>: Unfortunately it looks like SRS will continue to enjoy their harassment and downvote brigading. 


Edit: Come on, guys. I make a comment about downvote brigading and y'all mass downvote /u/spez for actually responding when he didn't have to.

<u/WhiteFlight2>: I thought you were going to provide a link with why a subreddit was banned. /r/coontown, despite being reviled amongst some users didn't appear to violate any of the rules. It also did well to enforce additional rules that places like SRS flaunt. Why was /r/coontown banned, specifically?

Which communities have been banned?

<u/spez>: Today we removed communities dedicated to animated CP and a handful of other communities that violate the spirit of the policy by making Reddit worse for everyone else: /r/CoonTown, /r/WatchNiggersDie, /r/bestofcoontown, /r/koontown, /r/CoonTownMods, /r/CoonTownMeta. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Content Policy Update

<u/TheMentalist10>: Will you be sharing information about the communities which are Quarantined? Will moderators of those communities know if their subreddit has been affected?

Edit: Just as it's not immediately obvious, **/r/Coontown has been banned**

Edit 2: [Here's what it looks like when you try to access a Quarantined subreddit](https://imgur.com/BkUsoz2)

Edit 3: [And here's what private subs now look like. Fancy!](https://imgur.com/k8fptkw)

<u/spez>: They receive a message, yes. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/Showerthoughts>: Reddit is like a friend that you think is really funny at first until you realize that they just repeat the same jokes over and over again.

Edit: Made it to the front page... where's my gold you circle-jerking hypocritical faggots?

<u/xrmb>: That problem could be solved by Reddit if your front page would somehow weigh links by redditors that vote like you... maybe it does already and its not working.

<u/spez>: Yep. Lots of plans for the front page. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!

<u/bbrazil>: Thanks for the update. Is it too early to ask what the alternative to shadowbanning will be? A block or tarpit by IP/Tor maybe?

<u/spez>: A straight-up, "you are banned because of X" is the first thing we need.

<u/MerryChoppins>: With the culture of reddit, won't that just encourage the worst actors to just make another account and proceed faster? 

<u/spez>: See my follow up task

<u/Rlight>: This just doesn't seem feasible. 

I understand that you're not ready to release the full information, but the entire point of shadowbanning, the entire reason that it's useful, is because users who purposely make alts to break rules don't know that they've been shadow'd. There's nothing reddit can do to stop TOR or IP changes which allow users to make alts. It seems to me, that Shadowing is the only deterrent that would slow down spammers and the like. 

<u/spez>: It ain't easy, but we ain't stupid.

<u/Ambler3isme>: In the end though, what's to stop someone just restarting their router for a new IP, making a new account and continuing with whatever they were doing? I have yet to see another site/game or whatever that is able to counter that, and it's a stupidly simple solution on the banned user's end.

<u/Sojourner_Truth>: By quarantine, you mean subsidize, right? Because every time someone pays for reddit gold, that money goes towards providing webspace for those subs?

<u/spez>: That is the most cynical possible interpretation, yes. It costs a trivial amount of money to host any particular community, and for communities the size we're talking about, the cost is basically non-existent.

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!

<u/[deleted]>: Spez, seven years ago, you made this commet in regards to hatesubs, as seen here: [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd)

Why the recent change in policy? 

<u/spez>: While my personal views towards bigotry haven't changed, my opinion of what Reddit should do about it has. I don't think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I'm sure our thinking will continue to evolve. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

<u/CardiganSquare>: Will the rules be open for discussion with the community at large or will it be solely developed and delivered by Reddit leadership?

<u/spez>: We had a very long discussion a week or so ago. Any policy changes we make will be open for discussion. At some point we'll need to draw the line and release them, but that doesn't mean they won't continue evolving.

<u/Ghazgkull>: Personally, I feel like the "long discussion" was a lot more "this is what we're gonna do, how do you guys feel about it?" followed by popcorn- and cake-eating than an actual, two-way discussion about the direction that the users and leadership want this site to go.

<u/spez>: We actually received a lot of really good feedback and wording suggestions. It felt dramatic at the time, but it was a worthwhile exercise from our point of view. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

<u/HandOverThePie>: You say quarantine the communities you don't wish to support, but how will this affect communities that are borderline questionable but still serious in their communication?

<u/spez>: We'll need to handle on a case-by-case basis. The purpose of this technique is to give us a way to contain and distance ourselves from communities that we would rather not exist but aren't overtly violating any of our stated rules.

<u/[deleted]>: [removed]

<u/bbrazil>: Thanks for the update. Is it too early to ask what the alternative to shadowbanning will be? A block or tarpit by IP/Tor maybe?

<u/spez>: A straight-up, "you are banned because of X" is the first thing we need.

<u/MerryChoppins>: With the culture of reddit, won't that just encourage the worst actors to just make another account and proceed faster? 

<u/spez>: See my follow up task

<u/Rlight>: This just doesn't seem feasible. 

I understand that you're not ready to release the full information, but the entire point of shadowbanning, the entire reason that it's useful, is because users who purposely make alts to break rules don't know that they've been shadow'd. There's nothing reddit can do to stop TOR or IP changes which allow users to make alts. It seems to me, that Shadowing is the only deterrent that would slow down spammers and the like.

<u/[deleted]>: What's brigading? 

<u/spez>: When groups of people coordinate attacks (upvotes and downvotes, for example). It's particularly bad when a single person creates many accounts to do this. This undermines the integrity of Reddit, and we'll work to prevent it as best we can. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

<u/Aaron215>: On the topic of PM harassment, how would you feel about a button that either party could press to allow a PM to be read by Reddit admins? It would open just that PM thread, and only to admins, along with a note about why it was forwarded. Sorry if something like that is already available. I just figure it's better than taking images that can be altered and it allows admins to follow along if the harassment continues from one user.

<u/spez>: 1. The ideas in the policy are easy. Wording them clearly is not.

2. We need to develop the corresponding tooling to enforce it. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

<u/TheBestUkester>: Thanks for the update, I appreciates being able to "see behind the curtain". I just have a few questions:

- Are there any hard deadlines for any of these changes? Projected ETA's other then ASAP?

- Is there a place (like a dedicated subreddit?) that we can tune into to see progress, or maybe offer support when needed? (Community developed tools that have become official come to mind.)

- And on that note, can we as the community do anything to enhance our corner of the Internet with you and the Admin team?

<u/spez>: > Are there any hard deadlines for any of these changes? Projected ETA's other then ASAP?

No, but we are on a very short timeline. Weeks, not months, and we've been at it two weeks.

> Is there a place (like a dedicated subreddit?) that we can tune into to see progress, or maybe offer support when needed? (Community developed tools that have become official come to mind.)

Not presently, but I'm open to ideas. The challenge is that during development we go through a lot of bad ideas, and it's easier to iterate on things when you don't have 100M people breathing down your neck.

> And on that note, can we as the community do anything to enhance our corner of the Internet with you and the Admin team?

Remember that we are people too, and our primary motivation is to make Reddit an awesome place to hang out. We are way less cynical than everyone thinks we are. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

<u/eax>: Are you gonna stop all brigading, or let SRS still do their thing as they have so far?

Otherwise, sounds good!

<u/spez>: We'll do our best. We can definitely see it happen when we look at the data, and it's super frustrating to watch. I know it's frustrating to be on the receiving end of it as well. We used to be much better about detecting this sort of thing, so I'm confident we can get there again.

We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting!

<u/bbrazil>: Thanks for the update. Is it too early to ask what the alternative to shadowbanning will be? A block or tarpit by IP/Tor maybe?

<u/spez>: A straight-up, "you are banned because of X" is the first thing we need.

<u/MerryChoppins>: With the culture of reddit, won't that just encourage the worst actors to just make another account and proceed faster? 

<u/scsuhockey>: How about suspensions instead of bans? Tell them the reason then tell them the length of suspension will be revealed within a short period of time. Basically, give them hope that they'll get their handle back for as long as possible to discourage them from starting a new account. Cruel, but possibly more effective.

<u/spez>: I think timeouts are an important part of this. Plus, it makes mods/admins lives easier. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

<u/brodies>: Reddit is [still losing prominent employees](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/07/28/reddit-employee-leaves/30778971/) working directly in areas which your post suggests Reddit is working on. What's up with that? And why no hiring announcements?

<u/spez>: Jessica leaving is entirely to do with her family moving back to Salt Lake City. She's not leaving right this minute, and she's helping us work through the Content Policy.

We are hiring at the same time, of course, but I'm just getting warmed up.

<u/[deleted]>: Why aren't you letting employees work remotely, away from the SF office?

(Marking this comment for the inevitable link to /r/subredditdrama)

<u/spez>: This policy will likely change in the long-term. In the short-term we need to come together internally. It's been a chaotic year for everyone here, and we have a lot of rebuilding to do. The vibe around the office is already better now than it was a few weeks ago (I hope they agree!), and in a few months we'll be a lot stronger. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

<u/genitaliban>: Thanks for the update! Official np.reddit would help with the anti-brigading things - not just redirecting to a different CSS but to a completely stripped down page would discourage a lot of infiltrations. And filters like /r/worldnews has them as a reddit-internal feature would also be great. The latter right now don't affect the frontpage, which many people see as an argument against them, plus they would help curb controversies over the prevalence of some topics in subs like /r/europe.

<u/spez>: Perhaps, but np.reddit is more of a hack in my mind. Acts of brigading are fairly obvious when we investigate the data. The challenge is to detect it in real-time, which we've been good at in the past. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Good morning, I thought I'd give a quick update.

Interacting with comments is next to impossible. Links won't let me click them. Pictures do some weird thing where they intersect numerous comments.

<u/a_calder>: While it isn't perfect, I enjoy using AB a lot more than any of the other clients out there.  AMRC gets mentioned a lot, but I used it for a couple weeks and my eyes couldn't take the pain any more.

The new CEO /u/spez has mentioned a few times that he thinks mobile is very important and reddit needs to do a better job. I'm not clear as to whether that is just the web/responsive version or whether he wants /u/jase to get the support he needs to make AB good again.

<u/spez>: Both, in fact. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

<u/spez>: We'll consider banning subreddits that clearly violate the guidelines in my post--the ones that are illegal or cause harm to others.

There are many subreddits whose contents I and many others find offensive, but that alone is not justification for banning.

/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

edit: elevating my reply below so more people can see it.



<u/jstrydor>: > We'll consider banning subreddits that clearly violate the guidelines in my post

I'm sure you guys have been considering it for quite a while, can you give us any idea which subs these might be?

<u/spez>: Sure. /r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

<u/xlnqeniuz>: What do you mean with 'refclassified'?

Also, why wasn't this done with /r/Fatpeoplehate? Just curious.

<u/spez>: I explain this in my post. Similar to NSFW but with a different warning and an explicit opt-in.

<u/EmilioTextevez>: Have you thought about simply revoking "offensive" subreddit's ability to reach /r/All?  So only the users of those communities come across it when browsing Reddit?

<u/spez>: That's more or less the idea, yes, but I also want to claim we don't profit from them.

<u/Sargon16>: How does it work then if someone gilds a post in one of the 'unsavory' subreddits?  I mean reddit still gets the money right?  Will you just disable gilding in those places?  

Or here's an idea, donate revenue from the unsavory subreddits to charity.

<u/spez>: Agreed, this is a problem if true.

The first step is give the mods better tools so they don't need to resort to tactics like this.

<u/doug3465>: How long will that step take? 

Admins have been promising this for years. Adding a realistic time estimate to all of these mod-tools comments would make sense. 

Edit: They said 6 months, and then their chief engineer quit because of "unreasonable demands."

<u/Georgy_K_Zhukov>: Recently you made [statements](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/cszykfo?context=3) that many mods have [taken to imply a reduction in control that moderators have over their subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/cszykfo). Much of the concern around this is the potential inability to curate subreddits to the exacting standards that some mod teams try to enforce, especially in regards to hateful and offensive comments, which apparently would still be accessible even after a mod removes them. On the other hand, statements made here and elsewhere point to admins putting more consideration into the content that can be found on reddit, so all in all, messages seem very mixed.

Could you please clarify a) exactly what you mean/envision when you say *"there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed. It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible."* and b) whether that is was an off the cuff statement, or a peek at upcoming changes to the reddit architecture?

<u/spez>: There are many reasons for content being removed from a particular subreddit, but it's not at all clear right now what's going on. Let me give you a few examples:

* The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.
* A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was *somehow* so we can better learn the rules.
* A mod deleted the post because it was spam. We can put these in a spam area.
* A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.

edit: A spam area makes more sense than hiding it entirely.

<u/TheBQE>: I really hope something like this gets implemented!  It could be very valuable.  

>The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.

*[deleted by user]*

>A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was somehow so we can better learn the rules.

*[hidden by moderator. reason: off topic]*

>A mod deleted the post because it was spam. No need for anyone to see this at all.

*[deleted by mod]* (with no option to see the post at all)

>A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.

Can't you just straight up ban these people?  


<u/GustavoFrings>: >Can't you just straight up ban these people?

They come back. One hundreds of accounts. I'm not exaggerating or kidding when I say hundreds. I have a couple users that have been trolling for over a year and a half. Banning them does nothing, they just hop onto another account. 

<u/spez>: That's why I keep saying, "build better tools." We can see this in the data, and mods shouldn't have to deal with it. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

update: I'm out of here, everyone. Thank you so much for the feedback. I found this very productive. I'll check back later.

<u/XIGRIMxREAPERIX>: /u/spez
I am confused on the illegal portion.
Are we allowed to talk about pirating, but not link it in /r/tpb
Can we have a discussion in /r/trees about why we should produce marijuana, but no how to produce it?

This seems like a very large grey area in terms of everything.

<u/spez>: Nothing is changing in Reddit's policy here. /r/trees is totally fine. At a very high level, the idea is that we will ban something if it is against the law for Reddit to host it, and I don't believe you examples qualify.

<u/diestache>: State that clearly! "Content that is illegal for us to host is not allowed"

<u/justcool393>: Hi everyone answering these questions. I have a "few" questions that I, like probably most of reddit would like answers to. Like a recent AMA I asked questions in, the bold will be the meat of the question, and the non-bolded will be context. ***If you don't know an answer to a question, say so, and do so directly!*** Honesty is very much appreciated. With that said, here goes.

#Content Policy


1. **What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech, but not harassing?** Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones. Are users, and by extension subreddits, allowed to behave in this way, or will this be banned or censored?

2. **What is the policy regarding, well, [these subreddits][5]?** These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole. These usually come up during AskReddit threads of "where would you not go" or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned. *(Edit: WatchPeopleDie shouldn't be included and is definitely not as bad as the others. [See here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/z/ct5sk10))*

3. **What actually is the harassment policy?** Yes, I know the definition that's practically copypasta from the announcement, but could we have examples? You don't have to define a hard rule, in fact, it'd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering, but it'd be helpful to have an example.

4. **What are your thoughts on some people's interpretation of the rules as becoming a [safe-space][6]?** A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this, and as such are not happy about it. I personally didn't read the rules that way, but I can see how it may be interpreted that way.

5. **Do you have any plans to update the rules page?** It, at the moment, has 6 rules, and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule 5, which is at best reaching in regards to it.

6. **What is the best way to report harassment?** For example, should we use /r/reddit.com's modmail or the contact@reddit.com email? How long should we wait before bumping a modmail, for example? 

7. **Who is allowed to report harassment?** Say I'm a moderator, and decide to check a user's history and see they've followed around another user to 20 different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot. Should I report it to the admins? 

#Brigading 

1. **In regards to subreddits for mocking another group, what is the policy on them?** Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever, such as /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/SRSsucks, the "Badpire", /r/Buttcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit. SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there. 

2. **What are the current plans to address brigading?** Will reddit ever support NP (and maybe implement it) or implement another way to curb brigading? This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits.

3. **Is this [a good definition of brigading][3], and if not, what is it?** Many mods and users can't give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it. This forces them to resort to in SubredditDrama's case, banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads, or in ShitRedditSays' case, not do anything at all. 

#Related

1. **What is spam?** Like yes, we know what obvious spam is, but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content. 
2. **Regarding the ["Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech" comment][1], how do you feel about [this][2], [this][7], [this][8] or [this][9]?** I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now, but it's not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions, especially during the /r/creepshots debacle, even with the literal words "bastion of free speech".

3. **How do you plan to implement the new policy?** If the policy is substantially more restrictive, such as combating racism or whatnot, I think you'll have a problem in the long run, because there is just way too much content on reddit, and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently. Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned.
4. **Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA, and if so, what was the point of it?** It seems like from the announcement, you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit, and this has made some people understandably upset.
5. **Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events?** I know this has been stressful, but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat (sometimes untrue, but whatever) experiences and whatnot. I don't think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself, but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team (and former team to be quite honest) are quite concerning.

<u/spez>: I‚Äôll try

Content Policy

1. Harboring unpopular ideologies is not a reason for banning.

2. (Based on the titles alone) Some of these should be banned since they are inciting violence, others should be separated.

3. This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someone‚Äôs inbox with PMs saying, ‚ÄúKill yourself‚Äù is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

4. It‚Äôs an impossible concept to achieve

5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). We‚Äôll be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

Brigading

1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but we‚Äôll keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

Related

1. The content creators one is an issue I‚Äôd like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it‚Äôs submitted with a script, it‚Äôs spam.

2. While we didn‚Äôt *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadn‚Äôt done before. Although I wasn‚Äôt at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isn‚Äôt too difficult.

4. No, we‚Äôve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that we‚Äôll incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.

5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm looking forward to moving forward and improving things.


<u/codyave>: > 3) This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someone‚Äôs inbox with PMs saying, ‚ÄúKill yourself‚Äù is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

Forgive me for a pedantic question, but what about telling someone to "kill yourself" in a public forum, will that be harassment as well?

<u/spez>: I can give you examples of things we deal with on a regular basis that would be considered harassment:

 * Going into self help subreddits for people dealing with serious emotional issues and telling people to kill themselves.
 * Messaging serious threats of harm to users towards themselves or their families.
 * Less serious attacks - but ones that are unprovoked and sustained and go beyond simply being an annoying troll. An example would be following someone from subreddit to subreddit repeatedly and saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an idiot‚Äù when they aren‚Äôt engaging you or instigating anything. This is not only harassment but spam, which is also against the rules.
 * Finding users external social media profiles and taking harassing actions or using the information to threaten them with doxxing.
 * Doxxing users.

It‚Äôs important to recognize that this is not about being annoying. You get into a heated conversation and tell someone to fuck off? No one cares. But if you follow them around for a week to tell them to fuck off, despite their moving on - or tell them you‚Äôre going to find and kill them, you‚Äôre crossing a line and that‚Äôs where we step in. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content.

3. This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someone‚Äôs inbox with PMs saying, ‚ÄúKill yourself‚Äù is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

4. It‚Äôs an impossible concept to achieve

5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). We‚Äôll be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

Brigading

1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but we‚Äôll keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

1. The content creators one is an issue I‚Äôd like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it‚Äôs submitted with a script, it‚Äôs spam.

2. While we didn‚Äôt *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadn‚Äôt done before. Although I wasn‚Äôt at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isn‚Äôt too difficult.

4. No, we‚Äôve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that we‚Äôll incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.

5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm looking forward to moving forward and improving things.

Uh, this would ban all bots

OKAY THANKS FOR THE REPLIES I  GET IT

<u/spez>: I meant specifically in regard to "content creators." For example, it used to be common that a site would write a script that automatically spammed multiple subreddits every time they wrote something. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

<u/mobiusstripsearch>: What standard decides what is bullying, harassment, abuse, or violent? Surely "since you're fat you need to commit suicide" is all four and undesirable. What about an individual saying in private "I think fat people need to commit suicide" -- not actively bullying others but stating an honest opinion. What about "I think being fat is gross but you shouldn't kill yourself" or "I don't like fat people"?

I ask because all those behaviors and more were wrapped in the fatpeoplehate drama. Surely there were unacceptable behaviors. But as a consequence a forum for acceptable behavior on the issue is gone. Couldn't that happen to other forums -- couldn't someone take offense to anti-gay marriage advocates and throw the baby out with the bath water? Who decides what is and isn't bullying? Is there an appeal process? Will there be public records?

In short, what is the reasonable standard that prevents anti-bullying to become bullying itself?

<u/spez>: > "since you're fat you need to commit suicide"

This is the only one worth considering as harassment. Lobbing insults or saying offensive things don't automatically make something harassment.

Our Harassment policy says "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them," which I think is pretty clear. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content.

<u/Warlizard>: In [Ellen Pao's op-ed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-cannot-let-the-internet-trolls-win/2015/07/16/91b1a2d2-2b17-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html) in the Washington Post today, she said ***"But to attract more mainstream audiences and bring in the big-budget advertisers, you must hide or remove the ugly."***

How much of the push toward removing "ugly" elements of Reddit comes from the motivation to monetize Reddit?

EDIT: "Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)" -- This is troubling because although it seems reasonable on the surface, in practice, there are people who scream harassment when *any criticism* is levied against them. How will you determine what constitutes harassment?

EDIT 2: Proposed definition of harassment -- **Harassment is defined as repetitive, unwanted, non-constructive contact from a person or persons whose effect is to annoy, disturb, threaten, humiliate, or torment a person, group or an organization.** 

EDIT 3: /u/spez response -- https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/lets_talk_content_ama/ct5s58n

<u/spez>: > How much of the push toward removing "ugly" elements of Reddit comes from the motivation to monetize Reddit?

Zero.

update: I'm out of here, everyone. Thank you so much for the feedback. I found this very productive. I'll check back later.

<u/justcool393>: Hi everyone answering these questions. I have a "few" questions that I, like probably most of reddit would like answers to. Like a recent AMA I asked questions in, the bold will be the meat of the question, and the non-bolded will be context. ***If you don't know an answer to a question, say so, and do so directly!*** Honesty is very much appreciated. With that said, here goes.

#Content Policy


1. **What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech, but not harassing?** Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones. Are users, and by extension subreddits, allowed to behave in this way, or will this be banned or censored?

2. **What is the policy regarding, well, [these subreddits][5]?** These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole. These usually come up during AskReddit threads of "where would you not go" or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned. *(Edit: WatchPeopleDie shouldn't be included and is definitely not as bad as the others. [See here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/z/ct5sk10))*

3. **What actually is the harassment policy?** Yes, I know the definition that's practically copypasta from the announcement, but could we have examples? You don't have to define a hard rule, in fact, it'd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering, but it'd be helpful to have an example.

4. **What are your thoughts on some people's interpretation of the rules as becoming a [safe-space][6]?** A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this, and as such are not happy about it. I personally didn't read the rules that way, but I can see how it may be interpreted that way.

5. **Do you have any plans to update the rules page?** It, at the moment, has 6 rules, and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule 5, which is at best reaching in regards to it.

6. **What is the best way to report harassment?** For example, should we use /r/reddit.com's modmail or the contact@reddit.com email? How long should we wait before bumping a modmail, for example? 

7. **Who is allowed to report harassment?** Say I'm a moderator, and decide to check a user's history and see they've followed around another user to 20 different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot. Should I report it to the admins? 

#Brigading 

1. **In regards to subreddits for mocking another group, what is the policy on them?** Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever, such as /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/SRSsucks, the "Badpire", /r/Buttcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit. SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there. 

2. **What are the current plans to address brigading?** Will reddit ever support NP (and maybe implement it) or implement another way to curb brigading? This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits.

3. **Is this [a good definition of brigading][3], and if not, what is it?** Many mods and users can't give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it. This forces them to resort to in SubredditDrama's case, banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads, or in ShitRedditSays' case, not do anything at all. 

#Related

1. **What is spam?** Like yes, we know what obvious spam is, but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content. 
2. **Regarding the ["Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech" comment][1], how do you feel about [this][2], [this][7], [this][8] or [this][9]?** I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now, but it's not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions, especially during the /r/creepshots debacle, even with the literal words "bastion of free speech".

3. **How do you plan to implement the new policy?** If the policy is substantially more restrictive, such as combating racism or whatnot, I think you'll have a problem in the long run, because there is just way too much content on reddit, and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently. Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned.
4. **Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA, and if so, what was the point of it?** It seems like from the announcement, you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit, and this has made some people understandably upset.
5. **Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events?** I know this has been stressful, but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat (sometimes untrue, but whatever) experiences and whatnot. I don't think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself, but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team (and former team to be quite honest) are quite concerning.

Like a recent AMA I asked questions in, the bold will be the meat of the question, and the non-bolded will be context. ***If you don't know an answer to a question, say so, and do so directly!*** Honesty is very much appreciated. With that said, here goes.

#Content Policy


1. **What is the policy regarding content that has distasteful speech, but not harassing?** Some subreddits have been known to harbor ideologies such as Nazism or racist ones. Are users, and by extension subreddits, allowed to behave in this way, or will this be banned or censored?

2. **What is the policy regarding, well, [these subreddits][5]?** These subreddits are infamous on reddit as a whole. These usually come up during AskReddit threads of "where would you not go" or whenever distasteful subreddits are mentioned. *(Edit: WatchPeopleDie shouldn't be included and is definitely not as bad as the others. [See here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3djjxw/z/ct5sk10))*

3. **What actually is the harassment policy?** Yes, I know the definition that's practically copypasta from the announcement, but could we have examples? You don't have to define a hard rule, in fact, it'd probably be best if there was a little subjectivity to avoid lawyering, but it'd be helpful to have an example.

4. **What are your thoughts on some people's interpretation of the rules as becoming a [safe-space][6]?** A vocal group of redditors interpreted the new harassment rules as this, and as such are not happy about it. I personally didn't read the rules that way, but I can see how it may be interpreted that way.

5. **Do you have any plans to update the rules page?** It, at the moment, has 6 rules, and the only one that seems to even address the harassment policy is rule 5, which is at best reaching in regards to it.

6. **What is the best way to report harassment?** For example, should we use /r/reddit.com's modmail or the contact@reddit.com email? How long should we wait before bumping a modmail, for example? 

7. **Who is allowed to report harassment?** Say I'm a moderator, and decide to check a user's history and see they've followed around another user to 20 different subreddits posting the same thing or whatnot. Should I report it to the admins? 

#Brigading 

1. **In regards to subreddits for mocking another group, what is the policy on them?** Subreddits that highlight other places being stupid or whatever, such as /r/ShitRedditSays, /r/SRSsucks, the "Badpire", /r/Buttcoin or pretty much any sub dedicated to mocking people frequently brigade each other and other places on reddit. SRS has gone out of it's way to harass in the past, and while bans may not be applied retroactively, some have recently said they've gotten death threats after being linked to from there. 

2. **What are the current plans to address brigading?** Will reddit ever support NP (and maybe implement it) or implement another way to curb brigading? This would solve very many problems in regards to meta subreddits.

3. **Is this [a good definition of brigading][3], and if not, what is it?** Many mods and users can't give a good explanation of it at the moment of what constitutes it. This forces them to resort to in SubredditDrama's case, banning voting or commenting altogether in linked threads, or in ShitRedditSays' case, not do anything at all. 

#Related

1. **What is spam?** Like yes, we know what obvious spam is, but there have been a number of instances in the past where good content creators have been banned for submitting their content. 
2. **Regarding the ["Neither Alexis or I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech" comment][1], how do you feel about [this][2], [this][7], [this][8] or [this][9]?** I do get that opinions change and that I could shit turds that could search reddit better than it does right now, but it's not hard to see that you said on multiple occasions, especially during the /r/creepshots debacle, even with the literal words "bastion of free speech".

3. **How do you plan to implement the new policy?** If the policy is substantially more restrictive, such as combating racism or whatnot, I think you'll have a problem in the long run, because there is just way too much content on reddit, and it will inevitably be applied very inconsistently. Many subreddits have popped back up under different names after being banned.
4. **Did you already set the policy before you started the AMA, and if so, what was the point of it?** It seems like from the announcement, you had already made up your mind about the policy regarding content on reddit, and this has made some people understandably upset.
5. **Do you have anything else to say regarding the recent events?** I know this has been stressful, but reddit is a cool place and a lot of people use it to share neat (sometimes untrue, but whatever) experiences and whatnot. I don't think the vast majority of people want reddit to implode on itself, but some of the recent decisions and remarks made by the admin team (and former team to be quite honest) are quite concerning.

<u/spez>: I‚Äôll try

Content Policy

1. Harboring unpopular ideologies is not a reason for banning.

2. (Based on the titles alone) Some of these should be banned since they are inciting violence, others should be separated.

3. This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someone‚Äôs inbox with PMs saying, ‚ÄúKill yourself‚Äù is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

4. It‚Äôs an impossible concept to achieve

5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). We‚Äôll be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

Brigading

1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but we‚Äôll keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

1. The content creators one is an issue I‚Äôd like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if it‚Äôs submitted with a script, it‚Äôs spam.

2. While we didn‚Äôt *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadn‚Äôt done before. Although I wasn‚Äôt at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isn‚Äôt too difficult.

4. No, we‚Äôve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that we‚Äôll incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.

5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that I‚Äôm here, I‚Äôm looking forward to moving forward and improving things.
 <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

<u/[deleted]>: When will something be done about subreddit squatters? The existing system is not working. Qgyh2 is able to retain top mod of many defaults and large subreddits just because he posts a comment every two months. This is harming reddit as a community when lower mods are veto'd and removed by someone who is only a mod for the power trip. Will something be done about this?

<u/spez>: I agree it's a problem, but we haven't thought through a solution yet. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

<u/XIGRIMxREAPERIX>: /u/spez
I am confused on the illegal portion.
Are we allowed to talk about pirating, but not link it in /r/tpb
Can we have a discussion in /r/trees about why we should produce marijuana, but no how to produce it?

This seems like a very large grey area in terms of everything.

<u/spez>: Nothing is changing in Reddit's policy here. /r/trees is totally fine. At a very high level, the idea is that we will ban something if it is against the law for Reddit to host it, and I don't believe you examples qualify. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content.

<u/bhalp1>: I generally agree with the outline above. Do you have ideas for the name of this second classification? I feel like this kind of thing is easy to conceptualize, hard to bucket and actually classify, and will come down to semantics. The naming of things is such an important factor in how they are accepted and understood by the community. Is there a list of names you are considering?

Thanks for the transparency. My favorite thing about Reddit is that it is a platform that gives a voice to the many without garbling in down to the lowest common denominator (but that also happens sometimes.) My least favorite thing are the hateful subcultures that exist and feel entitled to never have their views even questioned or criticized. I appreciate that Reddit does not try to decide what is right or wrong but I also appreciate a clear stance against hate and harassment.

<u/spez>: I've tried a lot of names, and none of them fit. I'm all ears. The challenge is that the content itself is very difficult to describe as well. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

<u/hansjens47>: www.Reddit.com/rules outlines the 5 rules of reddit. They're really vague, and the rest of the Reddit wiki has tonnes of extra details on what the rules actually imply. 

What's the plan for centralizing the rules so they make up a "Content Policy" ?

Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

<u/Darr_Syn>: Thanks for doing this AMA.

I'm a moderator of more than a few NSFW subreddits, including /r/BDSMcommunity and /r/BDSM, and as I stated in the teaser announcement earlier this week: this decision, and the specific wording, is worrying.

I want to specifically address this:

> Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people

As well as your earlier comment about things being seen as "offensive" and "obscene".  

There are sections of the world, and even the United States, where consensual BDSM and kink are illegal.

You can see where this is the type of announcement that raises more than a few eyebrows in our little corner of the world.

At what point do the minority opinion and positions be accepted as obscene, offensive, and unwanted?

BDSM between two consenting adults has been seen and labeled as both offensive and obscene for decades now.  

<u/spez>: I can tell you with confidence that these specific communities are not what we are referring to. Not even close.

But this is also why I prefer separation over banning. Banning is like capital punishment, and we don't want to do it except in the clearest of cases. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

<u/SirYodah>: Can you please speak on why real members are still being shadowbanned, even after you claimed that they never should be?

For reference: https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/3dd954/censorship_mod_of_rneofag_shadowbanned_for_asking/

Note: I'm not involved in any of the communities represented in the link, I found it on /r/all yesterday and want to know the reason why people are still being shadowbanned.

EDIT: Thanks to the spez and the other admins that replied. Folks, please stop downvoting them if you don't like their answer. I asked why people are still being shadowbanned, and the answer is because they don't have an alternative yet, but they're working on it. It may not be the answer some of you hoped for, but it's enough for me.

<u/-Massachoosite>: > Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)

This needs to be removed. 

There is no other way around it. It's too broad. Is /r/atheism bullying /r/christianity?  Is /r/conservative bullying /r/politics?

We need opposing views. We need people whose stupidity clashes against our values. Most importantly, **we need to learn how to deal with this people with our words**. We need to foster an environment where those people are silenced not with rules, but with the logic and support of the community.

<u/[deleted]>: You really need to clarify 

>Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)

because that's rather vague and is very much open to interpretation (one person's definition of harassment is not necessarily another's - is it harassment just because one person says so?). To be honest, I see nothing here that's really new to the existing content policy outside of "the common decency opt in", which I'm probably ok with - that will depend on how it's implemented and what is classified as abhorrent.

<u/Georgy_K_Zhukov>: Recently you made [statements](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/cszykfo?context=3) that many mods have [taken to imply a reduction in control that moderators have over their subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3cxedn/i_am_steve_huffman_the_new_ceo_of_reddit_ama/cszykfo). Much of the concern around this is the potential inability to curate subreddits to the exacting standards that some mod teams try to enforce, especially in regards to hateful and offensive comments, which apparently would still be accessible even after a mod removes them. On the other hand, statements made here and elsewhere point to admins putting more consideration into the content that can be found on reddit, so all in all, messages seem very mixed.

Could you please clarify a) exactly what you mean/envision when you say *"there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed. It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible."* and b) whether that is was an off the cuff statement, or a peek at upcoming changes to the reddit architecture?

<u/spez>: There are many reasons for content being removed from a particular subreddit, but it's not at all clear right now what's going on. Let me give you a few examples:

* The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.
* A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was *somehow* so we can better learn the rules.
* A mod deleted the post because it was spam. We can put these in a spam area.
* A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.

edit: A spam area makes more sense than hiding it entirely. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

<u/Warlizard>: In [Ellen Pao's op-ed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/we-cannot-let-the-internet-trolls-win/2015/07/16/91b1a2d2-2b17-11e5-bd33-395c05608059_story.html) in the Washington Post today, she said ***"But to attract more mainstream audiences and bring in the big-budget advertisers, you must hide or remove the ugly."***

How much of the push toward removing "ugly" elements of Reddit comes from the motivation to monetize Reddit?

EDIT: "Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)" -- This is troubling because although it seems reasonable on the surface, in practice, there are people who scream harassment when *any criticism* is levied against them. How will you determine what constitutes harassment?

EDIT 2: Proposed definition of harassment -- **Harassment is defined as repetitive, unwanted, non-constructive contact from a person or persons whose effect is to annoy, disturb, threaten, humiliate, or torment a person, group or an organization.**

/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

I'm sure you guys have been considering it for quite a while, can you give us any idea which subs these might be?

<u/spez>: Sure. /r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

<u/xlnqeniuz>: What do you mean with 'refclassified'?

Also, why wasn't this done with /r/Fatpeoplehate? Just curious.

<u/obadetona>: What would you define as causing harm to others?

<u/spez>: Very good question, and that's one of the things we need to be clear about. I think we have an intuitive sense of what this means (e.g. death threats, inciting rape), but before we release an official update to our policy we will spell this out as precisely as possible.

Update: I added an example to my post. It's ok to say, "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people."

<u/[deleted]>: Yea, but how are you going to determine that the subreddit itself is at fault? There's going to be a few individuals in all subreddits that cause harm, how do you determine that the sub itself is at fault enough to be banned?

<u/spez>: We won't formally change or policy until we have the tools to support it. Giving moderators better tools to deal with individuals is an important part of this process. Giving our employed community managers additional tools to assist the moderators is also required. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/announcements>: Let's talk content. AMA.

We started Reddit to be‚Äîas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks‚Äî‚ÄúThe front page of the Internet.‚Äù Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: ‚Äúbecause I don‚Äôt want that content on our site.‚Äù

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn‚Äôt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we‚Äôre careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit‚Äîor at least say on our public pages‚Äîin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone‚Äôs private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people.")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don‚Äôt pollute people‚Äôs enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor‚Äôs listings, and we think it‚Äôll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We‚Äôve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don‚Äôt want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it‚Äôs more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I‚Äôd appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this "Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them."

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of "harm"
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

<u/spez>: We'll consider banning subreddits that clearly violate the guidelines in my post--the ones that are illegal or cause harm to others.

There are many subreddits whose contents I and many others find offensive, but that alone is not justification for banning.

/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

edit: elevating my reply below so more people can see it.



<u/obadetona>: What would you define as causing harm to others?

<u/spez>: Very good question, and that's one of the things we need to be clear about. I think we have an intuitive sense of what this means (e.g. death threats, inciting rape), but before we release an official update to our policy we will spell this out as precisely as possible.

Update: I added an example to my post. It's ok to say, "I don't like this group of people." It's not ok to say, "I'm going to kill this group of people."

<u/Adwinistrator>: > Anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)

How will this be interpreted in the context of spirited debates between large factions of people (usually along ideological lines)?

The following example can usually be found on both sides of these conflicts, so don't presume I'm speaking about a particular side of a particular debate:

There have been many cases of people accusing others of harassment or bullying, when in reality a group of people is shining a light on someone's bad arguments, or bad actions.  Those that now see this, voice their opinions (in larger numbers than the bad actor is used to), and they say they are being harassed, bullied, or being intimidated into silence.

How would the new rules consider this type of situation, in the context of bullying, or harassment?

<u/spez>: Spirited debates are in important part of what makes Reddit special. Our goal is to spell out clear rules that everyone can understand. Any banning of content will be carefully considered against our public rules.

<u/spez>: First, they don't conflict directly, but the common wording is unfortunate.

As I state in my post, the concept of free speech is important to us, but completely unfettered free speech can cause harm to others and additionally silence others, which is what we'll continue to address. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/technology>: Reddit Chief Engineer Bethanye Blount Quits After Less Than Two Months On the Job

<u/[deleted]>: Am I hallucinating something or did /u/spez write and then delete a comment in this thread about 2 minutes ago?  Anyone else see it?

<u/spez>: I did. I mentioned I was disappointed because I was looking forward to working with her. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: [Request] AMA between /u/spez and the mods

Some of his comments in the public AMA regarding shadowbans and deletion are going to be of great concern to more than just a few mods.  I'm predicting another sitewide shitstorm if the concerns about it are not addressed sooner rather than later.

http://redd.it/3cxedn

<u/AsAChemicalEngineer>: I wrote these two comments in /r/modtalk and /r/IAmA. Here is the brunt of my concern:  
______  
From the AMA:  

>Ever. If we, or moderators, ban them, or specific content, it will be obvious that it's happened and there will be a mechanism for appealing the decision.  

"Would you agree that real users have a right to know when their post or comment has been removed?"  

>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  
<rant>Also, I hate seeing [deleted] all over the place. I don't care if it was deleted, I want to read it anyway.</rant>

"What about subs like r/askhistorians where they have high standards?"  

>I think mods should be able to moderate, but there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed. It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible.

"What do you plan on doing about censorship on reddit? An example would be /r/News censoring topics on TPP"  

>They can ban what they want, but I'd like to make it transparent what was actually banned. Some sort of "garbage can" or something.

Spez. I strongly advice you not to implement these ideas into reddit. This might kill a lot of really good subreddits and force others off default or /r/all.  

This is a question of resources. We moderators already can have very full plates. I for one know for a fact that if your ideas general even a trivial amount of more work for /r/AskScience, we will simply be unable to keep up. I believe /r/Science feels the same and many of the series subs like /r/history or /r/askhistorians would have objections as well.  
______  
Spez, I don't think you understand what an impossible idea this is. Some of the biggest and high quality subs moderate and remove thousands of comments for a variety of reasons. Are you telling us that we, moderators, need to be accountable for every single removal? This simply isn't a feasible prospect and the best mod tools in the world will not make it so.  

Why should /r/AskScience allow users to appeal our decision to ban young earth creationism in that sub? Or holocaust denial in /r/history? Why make more work for the good folks at /r/AskHistorians?

<u/spez>: I think I've said many times that my intention isn't to make anyone's duties more difficult. I believe we can build better tools that will save everyone time.

I also believe that shadow banning shouldn't be the only option because it isn't needed in many cases. It happens that in practice is *is* the only option, but we can build a better variety of tools.

After seeing all the discussion over the weekend, I think the most important thing we can do is work on tools to curb harassment of mods. I won't have time for an AMA tomorrow, but I'll find some time later this week.

<u/Amablue>: > I also believe that shadow banning shouldn't be the only option because it isn't needed in many cases. It happens that in practice is is the only option, but we can build a better variety of tools.

On this subject, if you haven't seen it before, I highly recommend  watching the GDC talk [The Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player) (and it's follow up talk [More Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player)) by Riot Games. It's targeted at online game communities, but I think most of the talk's take-aways can be applied to reddit as well. They talked about how ineffective their moderating was when they only had one tool (banning) and how drastically they improved things when they ~~game~~ gave themselves better tools which pretty strongly mirrors the growing pains that reddit has been going through lately. Both videos together are under an hour and it's well worth it. 

Edit: fixed typo

<u/spez>: Cool, thanks. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/ModSupport>: [Request] AMA between /u/spez and the mods

Some of his comments in the public AMA regarding shadowbans and deletion are going to be of great concern to more than just a few mods.  I'm predicting another sitewide shitstorm if the concerns about it are not addressed sooner rather than later.

http://redd.it/3cxedn

<u/AsAChemicalEngineer>: I wrote these two comments in /r/modtalk and /r/IAmA. Here is the brunt of my concern:  
______  
From the AMA:  

>Ever. If we, or moderators, ban them, or specific content, it will be obvious that it's happened and there will be a mechanism for appealing the decision.  

"Would you agree that real users have a right to know when their post or comment has been removed?"  

>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.  
<rant>Also, I hate seeing [deleted] all over the place. I don't care if it was deleted, I want to read it anyway.</rant>

"What about subs like r/askhistorians where they have high standards?"  

>I think mods should be able to moderate, but there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed. It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible.

"What do you plan on doing about censorship on reddit? An example would be /r/News censoring topics on TPP"  

>They can ban what they want, but I'd like to make it transparent what was actually banned. Some sort of "garbage can" or something.

Spez. I strongly advice you not to implement these ideas into reddit. This might kill a lot of really good subreddits and force others off default or /r/all.  

This is a question of resources. We moderators already can have very full plates.

Motherfucking trophies

Come on /u/spez I know that we're not supposed to talk about trophies, but you're the damn CEO. We deserve this! I love you. 

<u/gamehelp16>: /u/spez please!

/u/spez /u/spez /u/spez

Plis!!

<u/spez>: acknowledged. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/AskReddit>: What's the best "long con" you ever pulled?

<u/yishan>: Here's one.

In 2006, reddit was sold to Conde Nast.  It was soon obvious to many that the sale had been premature, the site was unmanaged and under-resourced under the old-media giant who simply didn't understand it and could never realize its full potential, so the founders and their allies in Y-Combinator (where reddit had been born) hatched an audacious plan to re-extract reddit from the clutches of the 100-year-old media conglomerate.

Together with Sam Altman, they recruited a young up-and-coming technology manager with social media credentials.  Alexis, who was on the interview panel for the new reddit CEO, would reject all other candidates except this one.  The manager was to insist as a condition of taking the job that Conde Nast would have to give up significant ownership of the company, first to employees by justifying the need for equity to be able to hire top talent, bringing in Silicon Valley insiders to help run the company.  After continuing to grow the company, he would then further dilute Conde Nast's ownership by raising money from a syndicate of Silicon Valley investors led by Sam Altman, now the President of Y-Combinator itself, who in the process would take a seat on the board.

Once this was done, he and his team would manufacture a series of otherwise-improbable leadership crises, forcing the new board to scramble to find a new CEO, allowing Altman to use his position on the board to advocate for the re-introduction of the old founders, installing them on the board and as CEO, thus returning the company to their control and relegating Conde Nast to a position as minority shareholder.

JUST KIDDING.  There's no way that could happen.




<u/spez>: We all had our roles to play.

<u/Kvothe_bloodless>: Am I the only one who feels odd upvoting the CEO of reddit? 

<u/spez>: Yes. Have you seen my comment karma lately? <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/KotakuInAction>: /u/spez is currently posting in /r/Gamerghazi

[deleted]

<u/[deleted]>: Like /u/Cleverly_Clearly said, I'm pretty sure he just responds to wherever his name is mentioned. 

/u/Spez, can you confirm? 

<u/spez>: Not exactly, but sort of. <|endoftext|><|startoftext|> <r/GamerGhazi>: All I am saying is, Give Spez a Chance

[deleted]

<u/madhaus>: Wonder if u/spez is a fan of the old Hewlett-Packard practice of "Managing By Walking Around." If he is, he really should be at least checking out these posts that namedrop him.  Unlimited Free Speech enables harassment, bullying, and Tyranny of the Majority (either in karma, in post quantity, or in gaming the system). The question is, does Huffman know this and not care, or are these concepts that never occurred to him since Reddit was created for bros like him so by definition I SEE NO PROBLEM HERE.

<u/spez>: Yeah, I see 'em. Most of them, at least (I won't get to read all 5k I received on day 1).

<u/madhaus>: Thanks for replying, u/spez. Would appreciate knowing you are taking in that there are problems endemic to valuing free speech above all else. Communities like this require constant comment pruning  and troll banning due to brigading and harassment. It is VERY real, and a lot of it is fueled by sexism and racism, not just political disagreements.

<u/spez>: Totally get it.

I know people are on edge about me right now. That's expected.

I think if we can build better tech for harassment, avoiding bans, alt detection, etc., a lot of the other problems become simpler.

<u/srhbutts>: thank you for taking the time to reply to people. means a lot. i know the volume of concerns must be overwhelming. 

a lot of us are concerned that ellen pao's departure will be indicative of the commitment on reddit's part to address harassment. if you could address that somewhere it'd be pretty amazing. 

harassment on reddit is a chronic issue, and disproportionately affects marginalized people on the platform-- as a random example, i'm a trans woman, and my dox/deadname/personal info have literally appeared hundreds of times on various boards on reddit and the vast majority of the time, the admins don't reply or even ban the offending users, much less the subs where these things happen chronically. 


i get the commitment to free speech, but the thing is, doing nothing re: harassment effectively silences people as well.

<u/spez>: Yes, I should have been more sensitive to the harassment angle yesterday. The next time I do a big public AMA, I'll keep that in mind.

In short, it's important, and I think there is quite a bit we can do. I want reddit to continue to grow, and I think one of the main obstacles to growth right now is how hostile reddit can be.

I know that I personally use shadowbanning via automoderator quite leniently as a way to stop people that are *obviously* trolls or have been *repeatedly* causing unnecessary work/drama for the mods. So it's a bit of a shock for me that the CEO is against this kind of thing when it's clearly such a useful tool. 

Anyway, I just wanted to see what the general reaction was to this.

<u/spez>: I'm not even talking about modtools in that quote. It's about the perception of reddit the company banning users, which I don't want us (the company) doing.

Everyone, let me be clear. My intention is to make your jobs easier. I'm not going to come in and remove a bunch of features you depend on, but rather to add more tools so clumsy things like shadowbanning aren't necessary. This is going to require some tech cleverness, but I know we can do it because I've done stuff like this plenty of times before.

I have a lot of ideas. We'll try them out. If things improve, we proceed, if they do not, we try something else. My goal is for you all to spend way less time doing mundane things like tracking down trolls, removing spam, arguing with idiots, etc.

My other goal is to remove some of the mystery from how communities are managed from the reader's perspective. Seeing people cry "censorship" every time a spammer is caught doesn't do anyone any favors.

Go on.....

I gotta be honest with you though, the second there becomes a target my head just because I'm upholding the clearly-defined rules of my subreddit, I'm done modding.  I don't need that kind of shit, so I really hope what you've got in mind can account for petty and pissed off users with nothing but contempt for mods and too much time on their hands.
