Title: I‚Äôm starting to believe everything I learned in relation to coding/software is inherently useless and it affecting my life

Body: I had an epiphany the other day of how I was currently living through my career after getting diagnosed with an incurable deteriorating illness.

I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that everything I learned for software engineering is just useless. I understand it is my skill that helps me pay the bill but that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs become for me. Learning about design patterns, advanced techniques, languages, it‚Äôs unfulfilling because while these are practical skills for work, they entirely useless in any other aspect of my life. I spend my days brainstorming how I‚Äôm going to refactor some webpage from Angular to React because my boss said so because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs on React now‚Äù. My coworkers argue and actually get angry about how the refactoring process should happen.

I just feel like I led a very meaningless and useless career that was mainly for the reason to kill time and have a living. It‚Äôs nice I have money but it‚Äôs all I got. I was always a money chaser who wanted to FIRE thinking I could start after I retired but now all my savings are drained due to my illness. I just can‚Äôt stand another day at work thinking that everything I‚Äôm doing there does literally nothing for society or even myself, besides the fact that I have money.

As much as money solves a lot of issues, it‚Äôs not solving my happiness. Maybe I can shell out more to see a third psychiatrist who says my mood is due to my illness and won‚Äôt help me at all.

Q: What do you think?
A: Coding is a really valuable skill. Have you considered volunteering and teaching it to others? I've personally found fulfillment in helping others learn to code. It's fun and free. Incidentally, one of the people who helped me learn to program was doing so because he head a disease that was going to render him braindead in ten years, so he decided to give back by teaching others.

Title: Six weeks ago I had my eyes lasered, and it's been among the best decisions of my life

Body: [removed]

Q: What do you think?
A: I'm so happy for you. I feel the same way after getting my eyes fixed almost three years ago. There are so many small day-to-day life improvements I've gotten to experience as a result. For example, falling asleep watching tv with my contacts in used to be a major mistake as I'd later have to pry stale contacts off my eyeballs while half asleep. Now, it's just falling asleep.
